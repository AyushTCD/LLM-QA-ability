White sheets FLAP CRAZILY in the wind... through the window we see Kitty put her drink down reluctantly. She comes out to grab a sheet that has come loose from the line... notices a JEEP idling at the gate, ARMED GUARDS patiently waiting.
I emerge from the house carrying an overnight bag. Kitty, one hand on the washing line, turns to look at me, curious.
KITTY
It’s happening, isn’t it?
I watch the sheets flapping. Glance at the guards...
OPPENHEIMER
I’ll send a message. If it’s gone
our way... 'Take in the sheets.' She nods. I head towards the waiting jeep.
KITTY Robert?

OPPENHEIMER Hans. Yes, he’s here. Yes.

KISTIAKOWSKY
No. Explain.
KISTIAKOWSKY
I can’t. I just know the implosion

OPPENHEIMER
If we fire those detonators and
they don’t trigger the reaction, two years’ worth of plutonium will be scattered across white sands.
KISTIAKOWSKY (holds out his hand)
A month of my salary against ten bucks says it lights.
I study Kistiakowsky. Take the bet.
WEATHERMAN
The wind’s picking up at Zero, not
the rain. Lightning circling. THUNDER. Rabi calls over-

Hey, weatherman, you think it might
be time to get your men away from the steel tower with the atomic bomb primed to detonate via electrical charge?

What did Fermi mean by 'atmospheric
ignition'?
OPPENHEIMER
We had a moment where it looked like the chain reaction from an atomic device might never stop. Setting fire to the atmosphere.

Why’s Fermi still taking side bets
on it?
