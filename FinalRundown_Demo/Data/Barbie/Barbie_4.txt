o for a walk or something!
He makes faces, then goes for a walk.
BARBIE MARGOT (eyes still closed)
Don’t go far! EXT. CENTURY CITY. DAY.
Ken Ryan Gosling walks under a sign for: CENTURY CITY. He looks up: A tall building looms over him and he starts putting together the world a little bit. He sees:
- A gym, full of men.
- A man in a mink.
- A policeman on a horse.
33.

 - A Hummer, stuffed to the brim with businessmen.
- Generic men in business suits shaking business conversations.
BUSINESSMEN
Great deal. Great deal. We’re
going to make a lot of money.
A female secretary tries to come up and something, he holds up his hand to stop
BUSINESSMEN In a second, Margaret.
(to his associates) Shall we all shake on it?
hands having generic
all
tell her boss her:
She backs away, submissive, as they all shake madly. Ken Ryan cannot believe what he’s seeing. Are they more powerful than she is?? How is this possible?
Ken Ryan Gosling rides an escalator up to a giant video screen, playing images of Big Man Stuff:
- Money, Presidents, Golf videos, mini-fridges, a bunch of dudes working out at the gym. Men in sports, men as statues, men in paintings, important men in photographs, the Greased Lightening scene from Grease, all culminating in Sylvester Stallone in a mink coat.
- MEN EVERYWHERE and then just another horse and then MORE MEN EVERYWHERE!
EXT. POLICE STATION. DAY
Barbie Margot still sitting on the bench, breathes in and out, and sees:
Glimpses of A Girl, maybe a pigtail, some chipped nail polish. She’s “Shining” or something like that. But without the horror!
- The Girl laughing with her Mom, eating ice cream.
- The Girl opening the door saying “Mom, I had a bad dream.”
- The Girl playing Barbies with her Mom - her Mom shows her a Barbie idea sketch and the girl applauds.
- The Girl is getting older, moving away when her Mom tries to show affection.
- The Girl plops a box of her Barbies and Barbie accessories in front of her Mom, clearly marked “Goodwill.”
34.

 - The Mom sadly drops her daughter off at school, and when she tries to wave at her, the Girl pretends not to see her. It’s junior high. Everyone is their worst self in junior high.
CLOSE on Barbie Margot, a tear rolls down her face.
Barbie opens her eyes. She wipes the tear from her face. She looks down at the moisture in her hand. She’s never cried before.
BARBIE MARGOT (to herself)
That felt achy... but good.
Barbie Margot looks around - across the street she sees a park, filled with mundane and beautiful and funny and sad moments of every day life.
- A young couple with a baby.
- Kids playing tag.
- A teen girl crying and being comforted by another girl.
- Best friends laughing together.
- A middle aged couple walking hand in hand.
- Three friends in an argument.
- An old man feeds the birds.
- Someone reading a book.
- A man with a child.
- Guys kicking a ball around.
- 20-somethings arguing.
- A young man who looks like he’s been crying.
Next to her an Older Woman sits on a bench, reading. Barbie studies her for a moment.
Barbies don’t get old, so this is something she doesn’t have experience with. The woman, as if she can feel Barbie’s gaze on her, looks up. They meet eyes. The Older Woman nods in greeting.
BARBIE MARGOT You’re so beautiful.
35.

 OLDER WOMAN (cheeky)
I know it. They laugh, it’s lovely.
Ken runs up to her, breaking the moment.
KEN RYAN GOSLING (O.S.)
BARBIE!
She turns to him, and he and Barbie excitedly say:
KEN RYAN GOSLING BARBIE MARGOT
I’ve got it!
I’ve got it!
KEN RYAN GOSLING What have you got?
BARBIE MARGOT You go first.
No you!
KEN RYAN GOSLING
BARBIE MARGOT Let’s go at the same time.
KEN RYAN GOSLING BARBIE MARGOT
Men rule the world!
She’s at school!
BARBIE MARGOT What was that?
KEN RYAN GOSLING The girl is at school!
BARBIE MARGOT KEN RYAN GOSLING
But what did you ? -- -- Nothing, doesn’t matter,
let’s go to the SCHOOL!
They both run off together, and Barbie sneaks a glance back, but the old woman is back to reading her newspaper, the moment has passed.
EXT. MATTEL HEADQUARTERS. DAY.
An imposing, many floored building. Masculine. STRONG.
A phone is ringing from somewhere. We BOOM DOWN from the top floor ALL THE WAY DOWN --
36.

 INT. MATTEL HEADQUARTERS LOWEST FLOOR. DAY. An endless forest of cubicles.
Hello? Split screen with:
MATTEL EMPLOYEE
INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS. DAY.
Men in those aviators for no reason, pictures on cork boards.
DAN AT THE FBI This is Dan at the FBI.
MATTEL EMPLOYEE This is Aaron at Mattel.
DAN AT THE FBI
I don’t give a flying squirrel who
you are Aaron! What are you, like an intern?
AARON DINKINS DAN AT THE FBI
I mean, not really an-- Two of your dolls have gotten
loose!
AARON DINKINS Impossible. How do you know?
DAN AT THE FBI
Don’t sass me Aaron! Couple of
blondes answering to Barbie and Ken rollerblading in Santa Monica. Claim to have no genitals.
AARON DINKINS Genital-less?
DAN AT THE FBI
We’re going to need Mattel’s help
landing the eagle. Don’t crap the bed, Aaron!
AARON DINKINS (concerned)
I won’t.
Sweating bullets, he hangs up the phone.
AARON DINKINS
This is bad. This is really bad.
37.

 38. Another younger employee peers over the top of his cubicle:
What?!
YOUNGER MATTEL EMPLOYEE
AARON DINKINS This happened once before.
Popping up from ANOTHER cubicle, three cubicles away:
AN EVEN YOUNGER MATTEL EMPLOYEE What?! When?!
AARON DINKINS
About ten years ago a woman named
Skipper turned up in Key West at some family’s home and asked to babysit the kids... She then tried to take their toddler surfing. We were able to straighten it out and keep it under wraps.
(grave)
But this is serious.
AARON DINKINS I’m going all the way up.
YOUNGER MATTEL EMPLOYEE No one goes all the way up! You may
never come back!
AARON DINKINS
I know.
INT. MATTEL HEADQUARTERS. ELEVATOR.
He takes a deep breath and steps into the elevator. Floors tick by 99, 100, 101. Walks briskly down a huge hallway.
INT. MATTEL HEADQUARTERS. BOARDROOM RECEPTION.
CLOSE on some sketches of Barbie. But these Barbies look distressed, mascara running down her cheeks from crying. She wears the identical clothes to Barbie Margot.
A woman, Gloria, sits at a reception desk. She’s in her late 30s, but has something of the kid in her, a pair of pink shoes? We love her! She is drawing the sketch.
Gloria has an old Barbie on her desk which resembles Barbie Margot. And next to that a photo of her daughter. She’s singing “Closer to Fine” to herself.
    
 Aaron stops at the desk. Gloria is so lost in her drawing she doesn’t see him. He clears his throat.
AARON DINKINS Um... Gloria.
He snaps his fingers. She shakes her head and looks at him.
GLORIA Oh, hi, Aaron.
AARON DINKINS (re: her sketch)
New designs?
GLORIA
Yeah, for some reason I just
started drawing her. I don’t know why.
She hands them to him.
GLORIA
It’s Crippling Shame Barbie,
Irrepressible Thoughts of Death Barbie, Full Body Cellulite Barbie.
AARON DINKINS
Yeah, OK.
(getting to the point)
I have to talk to the top brass.
RECEPTIONIST/GLORIA They’re in a big corporate ideas sesh. No one is to be admitted--
But Aaron is walking toward the door.
RECEPTIONIST/GLORIA (stage whisper)
AARON stop it!...
INT. MATTEL HEADQUARTERS. BOARDROOM
He opens a door to a giant PINK GLITTERY board room. It’s like the inside of a 5 year old girl’s sparkly heart.
MATTEL CEO (true believer)
Always be empowering girls! Always! What do we really sell? We sell dreams! Imagination! And sparkle! When you think of sparkle, what do you think after that?
39.

 He doesn’t wait for an answer, already so pumped to say:
MATTEL CEO Female agency.
AARON DINKINS Um... excuse me...
A table of men turns around all at once. They’re all wearing suits but it somehow feels like tuxedos.
MATTEL CEO Who are you?
AARON DINKINS Aaron Dinkins, sir.
MATTEL CEO
We’re in the middle of a major sit-
down here, Aaron Dinkins.
AARON DINKINS
But, I think you’re going to want
to hear this, sir.
MATTEL CEO
Can you just email it? And you can
send it to me EOD (proud)
End of day.
AARON DINKINS
May I put it in a whisper, sir?
MATTEL CEO Ugh, fine, whisper me.
Aaron Dinkins leans in and whispers something to the Mattel Executive #1. He’s ashen. He turns and whispers to the man next to him and each man in turn reacts and whispers to the man next to him. Finally, the CEO listens with shock:
MATTEL CEO
My god it’s a repeat of Skipper in
Key West.
AARON DINKINS
And with all due respect, that was
Skipper, sir. This is... (dramatically)
Barbie.
They all react. The Mattel CEO stands up, dramatically.
40.
 
 MATTEL CEO
If this got out, that our dolls were coming to Los Angeles from
Barbie Land as life-size versions of themselves and roaming the earth it would be very bad...
(lame finish) ... for business.
CUT TO: Gloria listens outside the conference room doors. She shakes her head, doing some insane calculation.
GLORIA (to herself)
Barbie? In the real world? (thinks)
No, that’s impossible. (thinks again)
Right?
We CUT BACK inside the BOARD ROOM:
MATTEL EXECUTIVE #2 We’ve got a definite situation on
our hands.
MATTEL CEO Catastrophic! I can’t stress that
enough! What’s your name again?
AARON DINKINS Uh, Aaron Dinkins Sir
MATTEL CEO Aaron Dickinson?
AARON DINKINS
Dinkins. Um, is Barbie Land like an
alternate reality or like our imaginations come to life or...?
Yes.
ALL OF THE EXECUTIVES
41.
 MATTEL CEO
Think of it as a town in Sweden,
Aaron Dinkins. (sizing him up)
How much do you weigh? Never mind. This sounds like a job for the box.
 Yes sir.
ALL OF THE EXECUTIVES

 MATTEL CEO
No one rests until this doll is
back in a box!
EXT. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL. AFTERNOON
Barbie Margot and Ken Ryan Gosling approach the school. Barbie Margot sticks out even more here, as the kids are all wearing dark colors trying not to be noticed. You know, Junior High School.
BARBIE MARGOT (looking up at the sign)
Look! Davey Crocket Junior High School! Just like I saw in my vision.
KEN RYAN GOSLING A man on a horse!
BARBIE MARGOT
We better find her soon, I’ve
started to get all these weirdo FEELINGS. Ugh. Like I have fear with no specific object, what’s that?
MOM (passing by)
Anxiety. I have it (re: the kids) They’re just awful
KEN RYAN I feel amazing.
too.
at this age.
GOSLING
42.
 MOM
That’s because kids don’t take it
out on Dads.
Cool!
KEN RYAN GOSLING
Kids are running everywhere. Barbie Margot and Ken Ryan Gosling try to not look sketchy.
BARBIE MARGOT
She’s got to be here somewhere.
They pass the library and Ken says, kind of suspiciously:

 KEN RYAN GOSLING
Hey, I’m just going to pop into to
the library and see if I can find any books on trucks...
BARBIE MARGOT
Okay, but don’t get in trouble!
KEN RYAN GOSLING
I won’t!
EXT. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL. CAFETERIA
Barbie scans all the different girls’ faces and then BAM - like Roy Scheider in “JAWS” seeing that kid getting eaten - she sees her Girl, the one from her vision!
Her Girl is sitting in a VERY prominent table with a group of other pretty 13 year old girls. She’s clearly popular. They all have Hydroflasks, big t-shirts, scrunchies, Mario Badescu Or whatever kids are into after this pandemic!
She begins to walk towards the girl but is interrupted by:
OTHER GIRL What are you doing?
Indicating the one she thinks is HER girl:
BARBIE MARGOT What’s that girl’s name?
OTHER GIRL (reverence)
That’s Sasha.
BARBIE MARGOT (calling out)
Hey Sasha!
OTHER GIRL (panicking)
NO DON’T TALK TO HER! Sasha can talk to you but you can never talk to Sasha. She’ll crush you.
BARBIE MARGOT
Don’t worry - everyone likes me and
thinks I’m cool and pretty.
OTHER GIRL (staring at her)
Huh.
43.

 Thank you!
BARBIE MARGOT
And then she goes up to talk to Sasha, and all these 13-year- old queen bees turn to look at her. NOTE: this is the opposite of what Barbie (and we!) think will happen.
BARBIE MARGOT
Hey ladies! Sasha, what’s up?
Sasha and her friends stare at Barbie Margot, stunned:
SASHA
(if looks could kill...)
Who are you?
BARBIE MARGOT
I’m only your favorite woman of all
time - Barbie! SASHA
You really think you’re Barbie?!
BARBIE MARGOT
They burst out with lots of mean laughter, unable to stop.
Well yeah! POPULAR GIRL #1
Omg she’s crazy.
POPULAR GIRL #3
So do you think you’re like pretty?
POPULAR GIRL #2
Do you think she’s escaped
from an insane asylum?
POPULAR GIRL #2 Tell us more about how you
think you’re Barbie. Okay, so you’re like BARBIE Barbie.
SASHA
Like a professional bimbo?
BARBIE MARGOT
No way! Barbie’s not a bimbo!
Barbie’s a lawyer. And a doctor. And a senator. And a Nobel Prize winner.
POPULAR GIRL #1 You’re a Nobel Prize winner?
BARBIE MARGOT (slightly defensive)
Well, not me. But Barbie is.
They all laugh in her face, again. Barbie is confused:
44.
 
 BARBIE MARGOT
Don’t you guys - I mean aren’t you guys going to thank me and giv
