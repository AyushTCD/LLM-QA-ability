LAWRENCE
You shouldn’t let them bring their

I follow his look: "SATURDAY 2:00pm, RALLY FOR LOYALIST SPAIN".
OPPENHEIMER
I wrote that. Lawrence, you embrace
the revolution in physics, can’t you see it everywhere else? Picasso, Stravinsky, Freud, Marx...
LAWRENCE
This is America, Oppie. We had our
revolution. Seriously, keep it out of the lab.
OPPENHEIMER
Well, out of the lab, my landlady’s

STRAUSS Yes, as I recall.
SENATOR BARTLETT
Why would they have started a file

STRAUSS
You’d have to ask Mr Hoover.
SENATOR BARTLETT
I’m asking you, Admiral Strauss.
STRAUSS
My assumption is that it was

How would these activities have
come to the attention of the FBI?

TATLOCK
You’re a physicist- do you pick and
choose rules? Or do you use the discipline to channel your energies into progress?
