e me a big hug? For being your FAVORITE
toy?
SASHA
We haven’t played with Barbies
since we were like 5 years old.
POPULAR GIRL #2 Yeah. I hated dolls with hair.
POPULAR GIRL #1
I played with Barbie but it was the
last resort.
POPULAR GIRL #3 I loved Barbie...
They give that girl a look.
SASHA
Anyways. Even then it was horrible
for us.
BARBIE MARGOT Horrible? Why?
Her friends egg her on, they know that Sasha can totally flatten someone.
POPULAR GIRL #2 POPULAR GIRL #1
Come, on Sasha.
Give it to her.
POPULAR GIRL #3 Destroy Barbie.
SASHA
Ok, Barbie, let’s do this.
Sasha’s verbal jabs are like a boxer relentlessly landing punches in a ring, maybe we even shoot it like Raging Bull. She is clearly so smart and so articulate that you can’t help but admire her.
SASHA
You’ve been making women feel bad
about themselves since you were invented.
BARBIE MARGOT
No, I think you have that the wrong
way around.
45.

 SASHA
You represent everything wrong with
our culture: sexualized capitalism, unrealistic physical ideals.
BARBIE MARGOT
Whoa hang on you’re describing
something stereotypical. Barbie is so much more than that.
SASHA Look at yourself!
BARBIE MARGOT (she has a point)
Well, I am, actually, Stereotypical Barbie.
SASHA
You set the feminist movement back
fifty years, you destroy girls’ innate sense of worth and you’re killing the planet with your glorification of rampant consumerism.
BARBIE MARGOT
But, but I’m supposed to help you and make you happy and powerful -
SASHA
- I am powerful and until you
showed up here and declared yourself “Barbie”, I hadn’t thought about you in years, you FASCIST.
Barbie bursts into tears and runs away. The Other Girl watches Barbie run, and just shakes her head.
THE OTHER GIRL They never listen.
We stay with Sasha for a moment, who suddenly feels bad. Under all the bravado is a lot of feeling.
EXT. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL.
MEANWHILE: Ken runs out of the school library with a bunch of books in his arms - Men & Wars, The Origins of the Patriarchy, Why Men Rule (Literally) and just one called Horses. His mind is blown.
A Female Pedestrian stops and asks, casually:
46.
     
 FEMALE PEDESTRIAN Excuse me, sir, do you have the
time?
KEN RYAN GOSLING (stunned)
You respect me!
FEMALE PEDESTRIAN
Um, do you know what time it is?
KEN RYAN GOSLING No, I do not!
FEMALE PEDESTRIAN
Thank you?
Ken feels like he was just declared king.
KEN RYAN GOSLING
Why didn’t Barbie tell me about
Patriarchy? Which, according to my understanding, is where men and horses run everything!
(inspired)
I shall seek my fortune there!
QUICK IMPOSSIBLE MONTAGE:
INT. OFFICE BUILDING
Ken Ryan Gosling addresses a businessman.
KEN RYAN GOSLING
I want a high level, high paying
job with influence.
OFFICE EMPLOYEE
You need at least an MBA and many
of our people have PhDs.
KEN RYAN GOSLING Isn’t being a man enough???
OFFICE EMPLOYEE Actually right now it’s the
opposite.
KEN RYAN GOSLING
But that’s not what books say! You
guys certainly aren’t doing patriarchy well.
47.

 OFFICE EMPLOYEE (winks at Ken)
Oh, we’re doing it well. We just hide it better now.
INT. DOCTORS OFFICE
We watch Ken also get rejected from a DOCTOR’S OFFICE.
FEMALE DOCTOR
No, I won’t let you do “just one
appendectomy!”
KEN RYAN GOSLING BUT I’M A MAN!
FEMALE DOCTOR But not a doctor.
KEN RYAN GOSLING FEMALE DOCTOR KEN RYAN GOSLING
Please?!
No.
Can I talk to a doctor?
FEMALE DOCTOR
You are talking to a doctor.
KEN RYAN GOSLING
Can you get me a coffee? And I need a clicky pen and a white coat and a
sharp thing! (sees a man)
There he is! Doctor! EXT. VENICE BEACH
And even from a BEACH. A life-guard listens, perplexed.
KEN RYAN GOSLING
I would like to apply for the job
of Beach.
LIFE-GUARD
Oh so you want to be a life guard?
KEN RYAN GOSLING
Oh I’m not trained to go over
there.
(points to the water)
(MORE)
48.
 
 KEN RYAN GOSLING (CONT’D) I’m trained to stand confidently
over here.
He points to the sand at his feet.
LIFE-GUARD
But nobody is in danger here.
KEN RYAN GOSLING (proudly)
And even if they were I’m not trained to save them.
Ken trudges away, rejected by the life-guard.
KEN RYAN GOSLING I can’t even do BEACH here!
Clutching his books, he returns to the school. EXT. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL
Barbie Margot is sitting in the parking lot still fully weeping from her interaction with Sasha.
BARBIE MARGOT (to herself, baffled)
She thinks I’m a fascist? I don’t control the railways or the flow of commerce??
Ken Ryan has arrived back at the school and approaches the same Female Pedestrian, now with her tween daughter. She’s not thrilled to see him again.
KEN RYAN GOSLING
There you are, that went terrible.
I need a place where I can start patriarchy fresh.
Barbie Margot is approached by bunch of CIA or FBI-looking types - dark suits, mirrored sunglasses, earpieces, but emblazoned with the Mattel Logo.
MATTEL AGENT Miss Barbie?
BARBIE MARGOT (sniffling)
It’s just Barbie.
MATTEL AGENT
You’re going to have to come with
us.
49.
 
 Ken watches from a distance. He freezes.
BARBIE MARGOT Who are you?
MATTEL AGENT We’re Mattel.
KEN RYAN GOSLING (to himself)
Mattel!
BARBIE MARGOT
OH THANK GOODNESS! I’ve got to talk
to someone in charge. It’s all backwards here. Men look at me like I’m an object, girls hate me, everyone thinks I’m crazy and I keep getting arrested.
MATTEL AGENT Just step this way, ma’am.
BARBIE MARGOT
I also just learned how to cry!
First I got one tear and then I got a bunch...
She keeps talking as Ken has a little conversation with the Female Pedestrian.
KEN RYAN GOSLING
What do I do? Should I go after Barbie into that scary unmarked
black truck car? (to himself)
A truck car I would like to have actually...
(back to the pedestrian)
Nah, she’ll be fine, it’s Mattel!
(excited)
I know! I’ll go back to Barbie Land. Wait until I tell the Kens what I’ve learned! Oh it’s going to be beautiful!
(sotto)
Back to Barbie Land!
FEMALE PEDESTRIAN (walking away)
Let’s go... that way.
Ken hurries off... And Sasha gets into her Mom’s car. It’s Gloria, the receptionist from Mattel! Now we get it!
50.

 GLORIA Hi Honey Bear!
SASHA
MOM! Don’t call me that!
GLORIA
Shoot, sorry! I got off early
because of a crisis at work. I thought we could go get soft serve this afternoon!
Gloria and Sasha see Barbie Margot getting into the van:
SASHA (unleashes the teen)
Thank god they arrested that nut
job!
(checking herself)
I mean: that reality-challenged woman. She thinks she’s Barbie--
GLORIA (can’t believe it)
Wait, what did you say?
CLOSE on Gloria’s face - WHAT?! It’s 1/2 of the “love look”: she recognizes her. But although Gloria can see Barbie Margot, Barbie Margot can’t see Gloria.
... as one of the Mattel employees shuts the doors on Barbie’s friendly face, and looks around all secret-agent- like as he gets into the passenger seat and they drive off.
EXT./INT. BLACK VAN. DAY
As the van zooms down the highway, a chipper Barbie tries to talk to the men in the car.
BARBIE MARGOT
Of course, Mattel! It was you guys
who wanted me to come to the Real World! Because it definitely wasn’t that Sasha girl.
No one responds.
EXT. GIANT MATTEL HEADQUARTERS. DAY
The scary black van pulls up, and Barbie steps out looking up at the giant building.
51.
 
 BARBIE MARGOT
Thanks for the ride! This has been
so much fun.
She is escorted through the big double doors...
BARBIE MARGOT (in awe)
Wow! The Mothership! INT. MATTEL HEADQUARTERS. LOBBY
Barbie Margot smiles as she’s taken through the lobby and up a glass elevator and it opens on to the top floor with all the executives... And she opens the door on So Much Pink.
INT. MATTEL HEADQUARTERS. BOARDROOM.
1/2 EXECUTIVES ALL TOGETHER Barbie! We’re so happy to see you!
THE OTHER HALF ALL TOGETHER Can we get you anything? Mineral
water?
BARBIE MARGOT Yes, thank you.
She’s handed a glass of mineral water which she turns and pours all over her open mouth and down her shirt. The lime wedge sticking to her cheek. They all stare at her.
BARBIE MARGOT (inspecting the glass)
I’m not used to that having anything in it.
The executives part, revealing our CEO, arms outstretched.
MATTEL CEO
We’ve been REALLY anxious to get
some quality face time with you...
BARBIE MARGOT
Of COURSE! So what can I do to
repair the rift in the space time continuum portal and get my feet back and that one cellulite gone? And generally just not turn into Weird Barbie.
They all look at her blankly.
52.

 MATTEL CEO
We have been discussing that very
topic. If you are agreeable to it, we would love it if you could just... get into this giant box.
A human-size Barbie box is wheeled out. It has the logo and plastic restraining straps and everything.
MATTEL CEO
If you get in that box, you’ll go
back to Barbie Land, and everything will be as it was.
Barbie thinks for a minute. The executives all impatiently lean forward. It’s taking everything for them not to just capture her and put her in the box themselves.
BARBIE MARGOT (finally)
You know what. We should probably get Ken first.
Ken?
MATTEL CEO
BARBIE MARGOT You know... Ken.
MATTEL CEO
Oh Ken! The guy. Oh right!
WE CUT BACK TO: Ken just screaming his lungs out on the rocket going back the other direction.
BACK TO MATTEL:
MATTEL CEO
... yeah, Ken isn’t something we’re
worried about... ever.
BARBIE MARGOT OK. I’ll get in the box.
EXECUTIVES ALL TOGETHER (relieved)
Oh, wonderful!
BARBIE MARGOT
But since I came all the way here could I meet the woman in charge?
Your CEO?
They all hesitate. The male Mattel CEO raises his hand.
53.

 MATTEL CEO Um, that would be me.
BARBIE MARGOT Well what about the CFO?
But it’s another man.
Man.
Er, me. The COO?
Me here.
EXECUTIVE #3 BARBIE MARGOT
EXECUTIVE #2
BARBIE MARGOT
Goodness gracious, what about --
President of the Barbie division. It’s another man.
Present.
EXECUTIVE #1 AARON DINKINS
Um, I’m a man with no power,
does that make me a woman?
BARBIE MARGOT
ARE THERE ANY WOMEN IN CHARGE?!
MATTEL CEO (emotional)
Listen, I know where you’re going with this, and I have to say I really resent it because we are a company literally MADE of women. There was a woman CEO in the 90’s and another one at some other time. Women are the freaking foundation of this long phallic building! We have gender neutral bathrooms up the wazoo! Every single one of these men you see before you loves women.
EXECUTIVES IN UNISON Up the wazoo!
54.

 MATTEL CEO
I am the son of a mother, I am the
mother of a son, I am the nephew of a woman aunt, some of my best friends are Jewish... what I’m trying to say is GET IN THE BOX YOU JEZEBEL!
Everyone gasps!
MATTEL CEO
What?! I can’t say JEZEBEL now?!
Barbie Margot seems unfazed, looks at the box.
BARBIE MARGOT
I haven’t been in a box in ages.
One executive steps into the box and then jumps back out.
MATTEL CEO See it’s easy.
BARBIE MARGOT
OK.
She slowly steps into the box.
BARBIE MARGOT
I totally remember this smell! I’m having a real Proustian flashback.
EXECUTIVES ALL TOGETHER Haha, Proust!
MATTEL CEO (to his neighbor)
Remember Proust Barbie? That did not sell well.
The employees surround the box somewhat menacingly. A Mattel Employee grabs the plastic ties from the holes in the back of the box and pulls.
Barbie Margot feels the restraints tighten on her wrist. She hesitates, it sinking in. She pulls her wrist out quickly just as the plastic cinches. Then she jumps out of the box.
BARBIE MARGOT
You know what? Before I get in the
box, can I just make sure my hair is perfect?
55.
 
 MATTEL CEO
It really is time to get in the
box!
BARBIE MARGOT But I want to look factory
beautiful.
MATTEL CEO
OK, but let’s hurry it up.
She backs over toward the bathroom and then zigs toward the double doors of the conference room. Then she BOLTS!
MATTEL CEO Get that Barbie!
INT. MATTEL CUBICLES. CONTINUOUS.
A BIG CHASE through the main bullpen offices of Mattel. The CEO and all the executives hurry after her. It’s like a giant maze. Barbie Margot darts around the cubicles as employees work, people pass from cubicle to cubicle popping up and looking around, trying to spot her.
MATTEL CEO (to the troops)
It’s quicker if you go OVER the cubicles!
The CEO tries to scramble/climb badly over the TOP of a cubicle and topples into an employee and a computer console.
Barbie sprints toward giant double doors on the other side of the room. The Mattel Executives in hot pursuit. She hurries through the doors and shoves a broom through the handles to hold them off.
Barbie enters a big hallway with lots of doors, she tries every one, but they’re all locked. Trapped! Panicked! She hears the executives getting closer. Then one door opens...
INT. MAGICAL ROOM FROM THE 1950S. ETERNITY
She enters the room and shuts the door behind her.
A VOICE (O.S.) Oh, hello, come in.
Barbie Margot sees a woman, dressed like a mom in the 1950
