didn’t do anything. I’ve
only ever wanted for things to be exactly as they are.
WEIRD BARBIE
Well however it happened, you and
she are becoming inextricably intertwined. You have to help her to help yourself.
Weird Barbie holds her hands out: this is a Matrix moment where Barbie Margot is offered two different versions of life, i.e. red pill and blue pill, except for Weird Barbie holds a high-heeled shoe in one hand and a Birkenstock sandal in the other. Very dramatic, full of meaning and moodiness.
BARBIE MARGOT (re: Birkenstock)
What is that?!
WEIRD BARBIE (cryptically)
So what will it be? You can go back to the way your life was--
(holding the high heel up) --and not even remember that this happened, or you can know the truth about the universe.
(holds up the Birkenstock and with a woo-woo voice)

 WEIRD BARBIE (CONT’D) The question is planted in your
mind. The choice is yours.
Breaking the “mysterious” spell, Barbie Margot answers instantly and with too much chipper energy:
BARBIE MARGOT
The first one. The high heel.
WEIRD BARBIE (annoyed)
No. We’ll do a redo. You’re supposed to want to know!
BARBIE MARGOT (cheerfully)
I don’t.
WEIRD BARBIE
Babe, listen. You have to want to
know.
BARBIE MARGOT
I'm not Adventure Barbie, I'm
Stereotypical Barbie. I'm like the Barbie you think of when someone says "think of a Barbie" and that's me!
WEIRD BARBIE That is so sad.
BARBIE MARGOT (closes her eyes, happily)
Okay, I’m ready to forget now.
23.
  WEIRD BARBIE
NO!
Why?
WEIRD BARBIE You’re doing this anyway.
I just gave you a choice so you could feel like you’re in control!
BARBIE MARGOT
So there is no first option?
BARBIE MARGOT (opening her eyes)

 WEIRD BARBIE
NO! You have to go fix the rip
yourself. Don’t blame me, blame Mattel, they make the rules.
BARBIE MARGOT Ugh, I don’t want to go.
WEIRD BARBIE
Fine, get cellulite, I don’t care.
Weird Barbie turns away. On Barbie Margot. She summons all her bravery. She wants to meet the moment.
BARBIE MARGOT (steels herself)
Send me through the portal.
Weird Barbie laughs, and then opens a toy-manual.
WEIRD BARBIE
Oh, no, there’s no portal to the
other world. That’s just a figure of speech.
We see the different vehicles as she rattles off:
WEIRD BARBIE
It’s a sports car to a speed boat to a rocket ship to a tandem bike
to a camper van--FUN--to a snowmobile--BRR--which will take you most of the way to the state of Los Angeles where you’ll don neon and rollerblades and enter the country of California. Weird, I know. Best if you don’t think about it too much.
Weird Barbie takes a swig from a flask with nothing in it (of course), presentation done. After all the energy she now seems tired of this whole business, and hurries Barbie Margot out.
BARBIE MARGOT
When I’m there, how do I find this
girl?
WEIRD BARBIE You will know.
BARBIE MARGOT And how will I get back?
24.
 
 WEIRD BARBIE
Same way you came, in reverse.
BARBIE MARGOT
Like I should go forward but do the
order backward or move backward and do the order backward or...?
WEIRD BARBIE (voice of Zuul) REVERSE EVERYTHING.
K.
BARBIE MARGOT
WEIRD BARBIE
If you don’t find her and fix
things, what’s ugly will become uglier, what’s weird will become weirder.
Barbie Margot screams.
WEIRD BARBIE
And then you will look like me.
Barbie Margot screams again.
WEIRD BARBIE
Gee, thanks. I understand. I set
myself up for that. Anyway, I believe in you.
BARBIE MARGOT (flustered)
Thank you... bye!
EXT. BARBIE DREAMHOUSE/CUL-DE-SAC. MORNING
Barbie Margot’s having a send off party with all of the Barbies - there is a big banner that reads:
“Bon Voyage to Reality and Good Luck Restoring The Membrane That Separates Our World From Theirs So You Don’t Get Cellulite!”
The Kens all stand to the side, a bit like men at a baby shower. There, but not. Ken Ryan Gosling and Ken Simu do a jealous mingle.
KEN SIMU
I guess she’s going without you.
25.

 KEN RYAN GOSLING (clearly lying)
No, she literally asked me, but I preferred to stay here.
KEN SIMU (provoking)
Why? Are you scared?
No!
KEN RYAN GOSLING
KEN SIMU
I’ll bet you’re scared and I bet
she doesn’t even want you to go.
KEN RYAN GOSLING You bet both of those things incorrectly! I bet the other
direction!
KEN SIMU
Which way is that? You don’t even
know.
Barbie gathers around her car with her friends.
BARBIE MARGOT
I just don’t want to leave! I’m
Trying to find reasons not to leave!! I’m going to miss you guys so much. I just wish someone could come with me... but you can’t. I should do this alone.
Back to the Kens. The other group of Kens are playing a very mysterious game which appears to be mostly guessing:
KEN KINGSLEY
What bird am I thinking of?
Parrot.
KEN NCUTI
KEN SCOTT
Dolphin. I mean, no, a bird.
KEN KINGSLEY (pleased)
PELICAN.
Back to the Barbies: all the Barbies finish bringing her stuff to the car.
26.

 BARBIE ALEXANDRA We’ll miss you Barbie!
BARBIE MARGOT
I’m going to be back in no time
with perfect feet and we’ll forget that this ever happened.
BARBIE EMMA
And you’ll get to see all the good
work we’ve done to fix the world.
BARBIE ANA
You’ll be such a hero to them!
BARBIE SHARON
All those grateful, powerful women
who owe their wonderful lives to Barbie.
BARBIE ALEXANDRA
I bet every woman will say thank
you and give you a really big hug!
BARBIE MARGOT (deep breath)
Yes! You’re right! OK, here I go! Bye!
BARBIE MERMAID (bursting out of the pool)
Bye Barbie! Good luck in reality!
Barbie Margot hops in her convertible, waving and driving off into the sunset.
INT. CONVERTIBLE/EXT. BARBIE LAND OPEN ROAD. MORNING
Barbie Margot drives and sings along SUPER LOUD to Indigo Girls “Closer to Fine,” which for some reason they have in Barbie Land. She’s loving this adventure, actually!
BARBIE MARGOT
“I went to the doctor / I went to
the mountains / I looked to the children / I drank from the fountains... AHHHHHHH!!!!!
Ken Ryan Gosling pops up in the backseat singing and Barbie Margot screams her head off and he screams at her screaming. They skid off the road, flipping over a few times and then landing upright in the desert.
27.

 RADIO
(Indigo Girls still
singing)
“Closer I am to Fine...”
Still hysterical:
BARBIE MARGOT What are you doing here?
KEN RYAN GOSLING I’m coming with you!
BARBIE MARGOT Please get out!
KEN RYAN GOSLING
No! I can’t! I have a double bet
with Ken, please, you can’t make me look uncool in front of Ken!
BARBIE MARGOT KEN RYAN GOSLING
Ken’s not cool!
HE IS TO ME!
BARBIE MARGOT
You’re just going to slow me down!
KEN RYAN GOSLING
What if there’s Beach? You’ll need
someone who is a professional in that!
BARBIE MARGOT (relenting)
Did you bring your roller blades?
KEN RYAN GOSLING (holding them up, smiling) I literally go nowhere without
them.
She thinks, and then relents.
BARBIE MARGOT OK, let’s do this.
KEN RYAN GOSLING (so excited)
Can I sit in front?
NO!
BARBIE MARGOT
28.

 He accepts this, and they’re OFF! Dramatic music as they go through all the different kinds of transportation.
HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)
So Barbie and Ken set off on their
adventure to the Real World! EXT. TRANSPORTATION
Sports Car - back in their car and on the ROAD! Into...
Speed Boat - Barbie drives the speedboat while Ken hides from
a seagull.
Rocket Ship - Barbie and Ken wear space suits and ride a rocket, which makes zero sense.
Tandem Bike - through the prairie OR the French Alps? Barbie on the front of the bike, Ken behind.
Camper Van - In a National Park they screech to a stop, jump off their bikes, and set up a little grill. Ken flips a burger while Barbie chills out in a lawn chair, reading a tabloid.
Snowmobile - BACK TO THE ACTION! - Ken hangs on to Barbie for dear life as she catches air over slaloms.
EXT. VENICE BOARDWALK
Rollerblades - Finally they are in the sunny state of California, in the town of LA, on the boardwalk of Venice Beach - wearing rollerblades.
Barbie Margot wears a bikini and Ken wears a onesie. They’re openly getting a lot of looks. Just the two of them in REAL Los Angeles is genuinely strange and hilarious. They appear as extremely good-looking aliens.
BARBIE MARGOT Wow! The Real World!
Ken smiles and waves loving all of this, but Barbie Margot looks confused bordering on anxious.
Note: this is more real than Barbie Land but still heightened, like a 1980s comedy - slightly exaggerated. Like there is no way Ferris Bueller sang the Beatles at that German parade, but we allow it because it’s fun. Same here.
KEN RYAN GOSLING
See, I told you there’d be Beach!
29.

 BEACH DUDE (hollering at her)
Give us a smile, blondie.
People are laughing and pointing and amused and also leering.
BARBIE MARGOT
What’s going on, why are all these
men looking at me?
KEN RYAN GOSLING They’re also looking at ME!
Ken winks at someone who winks back.
KEN RYAN GOSLING I LOVE THIS!
BARBIE MARGOT (looking worried)
I feel kind of ill-at-ease, I don’t even know the word for it... Like I’m conscious of it but it’s my self I’m conscious of--
KEN RYAN GOSLING (happy as a clam)
I’m not getting any of that. I feel appreciated but not ogled. Mine has no undertone of violence.
BARBIE MARGOT
Mine very much has an undertone of
violence.
Up ahead is a construction site, workers on break for lunch.
BARBIE MARGOT
Oh, great! A construction site! We
need that good feminine energy.
But as they get closer, it’s not what she thought. Construction workers eat sandwiches and cat-call Barbie.
CONSTRUCTION WORKER 1 Do fries come with that shake?
CONSTRUCTION WORKER 2
If I said you had a hot body, would you hold it against me?
CONSTRUCTION WORKER 3 Have I died and gone to heaven because you’re an angel.
CONSTRUCTION WORKER 4 Is that a mirror in your pocket? ‘Cause I can see myself in your pants!
30.

 BARBIE MARGOT
I don’t know exactly what you meant
by all those little quips, but I’m picking up on some sort of entendre which appears to be double, and I would just like to inform you that I don’t have a vagina and he--
(pointing at Ken)
--doesn’t have a penis. We don’t have genitals
The Construction Workers look at them blankly and then shrug, unbothered. This is Los Angeles after all, live and let live!
CONSTRUCTION WORKERS
Far out!... That’s okay... Whatever
works... you do you...
They’re actually very sweet guys. She blades away as Ken Ryan Gosling tries to impress the construction workers.
KEN RYAN GOSLING I have all the genitals.
He catches up to Barbie Margot.
BARBIE MARGOT Jeez, you would think a
construction site at lunchtime would be the perfect place for a little woman-power. But this one was so... male.
KEN RYAN GOSLING (a little excited)
Yeah everything is almost, like, reversed, here.
There’s a slight moment here. Like maybe he’s ON to something... But they’re distracted as they pass a large billboard advertising The Miss Universe Contest:
BARBIE MARGOT Look, the Supreme Court!
KEN RYAN GOSLING They’re so smart!
Another Beach dude passes by and slaps Barbie Margot on the ass. Barbie Margot punches him in the face. Ken screams.
INT. VENICE CENTRAL BOOKING. DAY
Barbie Margot and Ken Ryan Gosling’s mug shots.
31.
 
 Then they are being finger printed. Over and over again because the cops can’t find any prints. The cops drool over Barbie Margot:
POLICEMAN I love me a leotard.
POLICEMAN #2 I love the elbow pads.
BARBIE MARGOT (to Ken)
I think we should get some different clothes.
EXT. VENICE BEACH STOREFRONT. DAY.
Ken Ryan Gosling exits wearing all denim with fringe and a cowboy hat, followed by Barbie Margot, who wears a pink cowgirl outfit. ALL the security lights and bells go, but they are oblivious.
BARBIE MARGOT We look great!
KEN RYAN GOSLING (admiring his reflection)
I LOVE FRINGE!
BARBIE MARGOT I love denim!
A Security Guard rushes after them, panicked.
SECURITY GUARD
Hey! You two! What are you doing?!
You have to pay for those! They give chase!
INT. VENICE CENTRAL BOOKING. AGAIN. DAY
Barbie Margot and Ken Ryan, getting finger printed. The male
cops are still leering.
POLICE MAN #2
She’s even sexier in clothes.
POLICE MAN
I know, because you can imagine
32.
 more.
You know what? Keep ‘em!
POLICE MAN #2

 BARBIE MARGOT
Goddammit! EXT. POLICE STATION. DAY
Barbie Margot and Ken Ryan Gosling emerge into the midday LA sun, wearing their stolen/gifted clothes.
BARBIE MARGOT
Weird Barbie said I’d know how to
find this girl, but I have NO IDEA. (takes a deep breath)
What would a smart Barbie do? I just need to clear my mind so I can think.
Barbie sits down on a bench, almost like she’s meditating.
KEN RYAN GOSLING (annoyed)
I hate it when people think. I’m so bored!
BARBIE MARGOT
The faster I figure this out, the
faster we get home.
She closes her eyes. Ken Ryan Gosling gets all antsy like a kid, unable to sit still.
KEN RYAN GOSLING (lost without her)
What am I supposed to do?!
BARBIE MARGOT
G
