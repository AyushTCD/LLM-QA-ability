STRAUSS
Senator, I can’t possibly answer
for a security clearance granted years before I even met the man.
SENATOR PASTORE Fine. What about after?
STRAUSS
After the war, Dr Oppenheimer was
the most respected scientific voice in the world. That’s why I asked him to run the Institute, that’s why he advised the Atomic Energy Commission. Simple as that.
INT. SENATE OFFICE -- DAY (B&W) Strauss paces-
STRAUSS
What are they accusing me of?

I think they just want to know what
happened between 1947 and 1954 to change your mind on Oppenheimer’s security clearance.

This was the McCarthy era- people
hounded out of jobs for any hint of red... reading Oppenheimer’s security file- his Communist brother, sister-in-law, fiancée, best friend, wife... that’s before you even get to the Chevalier incident.
SENATE AIDE
But how would Borden have access to
Oppenheimer’s security file?
STRAUSS
Someone gave it to him. Someone who
wanted Oppenheimer silenced.
Who?
SENATE AIDE
STRAUSS
Who knows? Robert didn’t take care
not to upset the power brokers in Washington. His opinions on the atom became definitive and he wasn’t always patient with us mere mortals. I came in for plenty of harsh treatment. There was an AEC vote on the export of isotopes to Norway...

Congressman, you could use a shovel
in making atomic weapons, in fact, you do. You could use a bottle of beer in making atomic weapons. In fact, you do.

Werner Heisenberg. He has the most
intuitive understanding of atomic structure I’ve ever seen.

Walther Bothe. Von Weizsäcker. Diebner. In a straight race, the Germans win. We’ve got one hope.

All minds have to see the whole task to contribute efficiently.
Poor security may cost us the race, inefficiency will. The Germans know more than us, anyway.
