OPPENHEIMER
America and Russia may be likened
to two scorpions in a bottle, each capable of killing the other, but only at the risk of his own life. There are various aspects of this policy which I would like to discuss but can’t. Follies that can occur only when even the men who know the facts can find no one to talk about them, when the facts are too secret for discussion, and thus for thought. Candor is the only remedy. Officials in Washington have to start levelling with the American people, and telling them what the enemy already know about the atomic armaments race.

But how could Borden get access to
Oppenheimer’s FBI file? Could it have been Nichols?
