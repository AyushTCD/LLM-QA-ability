m trying to
escape. I cannot sit on ONE MORE LEATHER COUCH. It’s gonna break my SPIRIT.
79.
 
 Up ahead the Kens are building a wall. It’s partially constructed, and hard hat Kens hammer and dig.
ALLAN
Once they figure out how to build
that wall sideways and not just up, no one will be able to get in or out.
It’s true: they’re building the wall STRAIGHT up, not across.
ALLAN
If we want to leave we better make
a run for it.
GLORIA
Allan, you can’t go. Having a
Barbie in the real world is what caused all these problems in the first place.
ALLAN
Not one person would care if Allan
was in the real world. In fact it’s happened before...
(a secret)
All of NSYNC... Allan.
Off their looks--
ALLAN
Yes, even him. So... COME ON!
KEN CONSTRUCTION WORKER Hey, you there!
Allan casually stands and walks towards the Kens.
ALLAN
(to Gloria and Sasha)
Just get in the car and keep it singing... be ready for anything.
(to the Ken) Hey man!
KEN CONSTRUCTION WORKER Who are you?
ALLAN
I’m Allan, I’m Ken’s buddy? All his
clothes fit me!!
80.
  
 Allan charges at the Kens and takes them all on, rather impressively. Gloria and Sasha scramble to the car. Sasha lands in the driver’s seat and REVS:
GLORIA
You don’t have a driver’s license!
SASHA
And this car doesn’t have an
engine!
Sasha looks beyond the wall and back to the Real World - and then in the other direction, back to Barbie Land.
GLORIA
What are you doing?! Let’s GO!
Sasha looks at Gloria. And then, inspired:
SASHA
We have to go back. Barbie Land
needs saving. Barbie needs saving. GLORIA
But you hate Barbie!
SASHA
But you don’t! You’ve always
believed in what she could be.
GLORIA
Well I was wrong. Barbie gave up.
The Kens won.
SASHA
Mom, you have to try! Even if you
can’t make it perfect you can make it better.
GLORIA (breaking)
I can’t make anything better! I’m the one who ruined Barbie Land with my stupid drawings in the first place.
SASHA (firm)
They’re not stupid! They’re amazing...
GLORIA (tearing up)
You like my drawings?
81.
 
 SASHA
They’re weird and dark and crazy.
Everything you pretend not to be.
GLORIA
I am... I am weird, dark and crazy.
Allan punches the last Ken and takes a threatening step toward the remaining beleaguered Kens.
ALLAN
You want some more Allan?!
And he turns and runs back to the car.
ALLAN
We have to get out of here RIGHT
NOW! Gloria hesitates.
GLORIA
Shut up Allan! We’re going back.
Let’s go help my doll.
Gloria and Sasha beam at each other. Sasha steps on the gas,
turns the wheel and they swing back toward Barbie Land. ALLAN
I’ll never get out of here.
SASHA
Where can we find Barbie?
ALLAN
There’s only one place she’d be.
INT. WEIRD BARBIE'S WEIRDHOUSE. DAY
Barbie Margot has joined Weird Barbie and her motley crew - the reject Barbies, Earring Magic Ken, Sugar Daddy Ken, Growing up Skipper -- her boobs grow when she lifts her arm -- Teen Talk Barbie, Tanner the pooping Dog, Video Girl Barbie.
Barbie Margot is lying on the floor, unable to do anything, totally without any will to live. Teen Talk Barbie and Video Girl Barbie attempt to un-brainwash Barbie Alexandra.
TEEN TALK BARBIE (to Barbie Alexandra)
You’re a writer. This is your Nobel Prize. Remember?
82.
 
 Barbie Alexandra goes into one of those acceptance speeches women give, totally self-effacing and not embracing the win.
BARBIE ALEXANDRA
Oh my God, I don’t even know how I
got here. I don’t deserve this! I’d like to thank Ken.
WEIRD BARBIE (entering the room)
It’s pointless trying to deprogram her. I’ve already tried.
(looking at Barbie Margot)
The fork in my soup is this, Barb: why didn’t the brainwashing work on you?
BARBIE MARGOT (still face down)
My exposure to Patriarchy in the real world made me immune. Either you’re brainwashed or you’re weird and ugly. There is no in-between.
WEIRD BARBIE Sing it sister.
(to the group)
Get ready to live in the shadows and on the margins because in 48 hours Barbie Land becomes Ken Land.
They hear voices. Everyone screams and then tries to hide, badly. Except for Barbie Margot, who doesn’t move. Other Barbies step over her. Some try to freeze like statues.
WEIRD BARBIE
It’s the Kens! They’ve found us!
The sound of footsteps grow louder. Until finally Gloria, Sasha and Allan are standing there.
83.
  HUMANS!
AND ALLAN!
WEIRD BARBIE ALLAN
 The lights go on and they all emerge out of their random hiding places. Barbie Margot half clocks Gloria and Sasha and tries to pull herself away, out of their sight.

 WEIRD BARBIE (to Sasha and Gloria)
Welcome, welcome to my Weirdhouse - I’m Weird Barbie. I’m in the splits, have a funky hair cut and I smell like basement.
GLORIA
OH MY GOD I HAD A WEIRD BARBIE!
WEIRD BARBIE Yeah you did.
GLORIA
YOU MAKE THEM WEIRD BY PLAYING TOO
HARD!
Again, we take in the group as Gloria identifies each one --
GLORIA
That’s Sugar Daddy Ken! And Earring
Magic Ken! Mattel discontinued them...
SASHA
Sugar Daddy Ken? WTF?
SUGAR DADDY KEN
No, no, I’m not a Sugar Daddy. This
is Sugar.
(holding up a dog)
And I’m her Daddy.
EARRING MAGIC KEN And I have an earring. A magic
earring.
GLORIA (to Sasha)
Yeah, those were actual Kens. (identifying all of them)
And-- more discontinued Barbies!! Growing Up Skipper?! May I?
(to Sasha) Watch this!
Gloria lifts Growing Up Skipper’s arm and her boobs inflate. This is as weird as it sounds.
GLORIA See! Her boobs grow!
84.

 SASHA (aghast)
Why would they do that?
Gloria continues down the line of discontinued Barbies.
GLORIA
And Barbie Video Girl!
BARBIE VIDEO GIRL
I have a TV in my back. You know
whose dream that is? Nobody. It’s nobody’s dream.
WEIRD BARBIE
And that’s Barbie Barbie, of
course... she’s not dead she’s just having an existential crisis.
Gloria and Sasha walk over to Barbie Margot who hasn’t gotten very far. She just presses her face to the ground.
Gloria turns her over. Barbie Margot hides her face with her hands. Gloria gently moves them away.
And there is unadorned Barbie Margot, no makeup, nothing special just her (which WE KNOW is INSANELY BEAUTIFUL, don’t worry.) Barbie Margot totally falls apart weeping. Like a toddler crying.
GLORIA What’s wrong?
BARBIE MARGOT (between sobs)
I’m... not... pretty... any... more...
GLORIA
What? You’re SO pretty.
BARBIE MARGOT (shaking her head)
Not “Stereotypical Barbie” pretty...
HELEN MIRREN (V.O.) (interrupting)
Note to the filmmakers: You should have never cast Margot Robbie if you wanted to make this point.
GLORIA You are beautiful.
85.

 BARBIE MARGOT
... it’s not just that... I’m not
smart enough to be interesting...
GLORIA But you ARE smart.
BARBIE MARGOT
I can’t do brain surgery, I’ve
never flown a plan, I’m not president, no one on the Supreme Court is me... I’m just... not... good... enough...for... anything ...
She sobs bitterly. Gloria shakes her head, feels deeply:
GLORIA
IT IS LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO BE A
WOMAN! You are so beautiful and so smart and it kills me that you don’t think you’re good enough. Like we have to always be extraordinary and somehow we’re always doing it wrong. You’re supposed to be THIN but not TOO THIN and you can never say you want to be THIN you have to say you want to be HEALTHY but you also have to BE thin. You have to have money but you can’t ask for money because that’s crass. You have to be a boss but you can’t be mean. You’re supposed to lead but you can’t squash other people’s ideas. You’re supposed to LOVE being a mother but don’t talk about your kids all the damn time. You’re supposed to be a career woman but always be looking out for other people. You have to answer for men’s bad behavior, which is INSANE, but if you point that out then you’re accused of complaining. You’re supposed to be pretty for men but not SO pretty that you tempt them too much or threaten other women. You’re supposed to be part of the sisterhood but also stand out but also always be grateful. You have to never get old never be rude never show off never be selfish never fall down never fail never show fear never get out of line.
86.
 (MORE)

 GLORIA (CONT’D) It’s too hard, it’s too
contradictory and no one says thank you or gives you a medal, and in fact, it turns out, somehow, that not only are you doing it all wrong but that everything is also YOUR fault. I’m just so damn tired of watching myself and every single other women tie ourselves in knots so that people will like us. And if all that is also true for a doll just representing a woman then I don’t even know!
Exhausted, she sits down. Allan is in tears, they all are. Maybe a slow clap? And then:
BARBIE ALEXANDRA Wait, I did write a book.
(rubbing her eyes)
It was like I was in some dream where I was somehow really invested in the Zack Snyder cut of Justice League.
(shaking her head, looking to Gloria)
But what you said - it broke me out of it.
GLORIA Really?!
WEIRD BARBIE She’s back! You’re back!
Sasha looks at her mom like she’s seeing her for the first time. She is proud.
Barbie Margot stands up. And we MOVE in on her pure, tear- streaked face.
BARBIE MARGOT
By giving voice to the cognitive
dissonance required to be a woman under the patriarchy, you robbed it of it’s power.
Gloria, Sasha and everyone else turns to Barbie Margot:
BARBIE MARGOT (surprised and impressed)
Woah, I just said all of that.
87.
  
 SASHA
Hell yes, White Savior Barbie!
BARBIE MARGOT
No, it was your Mom. She did the
saving.
Sasha fist bumps her. Barbie Margot is amazed. She suddenly has new authority, a deeper voice, from a place of real knowing, like Olivia de Havilland at the end of “The Heiress.” (Now, go watch that movie!)
BARBIE MARGOT We have to stop the Kens.
(to Gloria)
You’ve got to say those things to all the other Barbies. That’s the key.
BARBIE ALEXANDRA
How will we get them away from
their Kens?
SASHA
We have experience with a world
like this one.
BARBIE MARGOT (to Weird Barbie)
Do you have a map of Barbie Land?
WEIRD BARBIE (triumphantly)
What do you think.
A large 3D map of Barbie Land opens up (like a Murphy bed) from the wall.
CUT TO: HEIST MONTAGE. We see the execution of the plan as Barbie Margot, Gloria and Sasha lay out the details. (You know that thing, you’ve seen it in every heist movie ever!)
BARBIE MARGOT
Here’s the deal. It’s not just
about how they see us, it’s about how they see themselves.
GLORIA
Ken Land contains the seeds of its
own destruction.
BARBIE MARGOT
First we have to get the Barbies
away from their Kens. (MORE)
88.

 BARBIE MARGOT (CONT’D) We can use a decoy Barbie who
pretends to be brainwashed. (to Barbie Alexandra)
That should be you.
SASHA
We’ll distract them by pretending
to be helpless and confused. Kens can’t resist a damsel in distress.
GLORIA
You have to make them believe that
you’re complacent and that they have the power. And when their guard is down you can take the power back.
CUT TO: The Barbie Busytown Street. The “heist Barbies” pile out of Weird Barbie’s tank-car. Barbie Alexandra sits in a cafe on her laptop. She nods to the “heist Barbies” as Ken Simu strolls by with Barbie Issa.
KEN SIMU
The influence that Porsche 356 has
had on the motoring world as a whole cannot be overstated.
BARBIE ISSA
The 356! How could I be so
ignorant?!
BARBIE ALEXANDRA (theatrically)
Ugh Photoshop is so hard! I just don’t understand how to use the Select tool!
Ken Simu immediately leaves Barbie Issa’s side for Barbie Alexandra.
KEN SIMU Oh, honey, you can Select tool if the highlighted. Here,
only use the layer is
let me show
you...
He wraps his arms around her to use her keyboard.
BARBIE ALEXANDRA
Ugh my tiny head is just swimming
with technical jargon like color bands and magnetic lassos...
89.

 BARBIE MARGOT (V.O.) Once they’re engaged, we’ll spirit
away their Barbie and deprogram her-
We see Barbie Margot and Allan hurrying Barbie Issa away from the scene. She’s thrown into the Weird Barbie tank-car and Gloria de-programs her:
GLORIA
(at Barbie Issa)
... you’re supposed to be their mommies but not remind them of their mommy, any power you have must be masked under a giggle...
This snaps Barbie Issa out of her stupor.
BARBIE ISSA (blinks)
What happened? One day I was president, the next thing I know I was cutting a Ken’s steak for him...?
GLORIA
Welcome back, Madame President.
BARBIE MARGOT (V.O.) And then we’ll recruit the now
unbrainwashed Barbies to our cause. They can be the new decoys.
INTERCUT THE PLAN. The Barbies distract the Kens by pretending to be helpless and then Gloria deprograms them.
GLORIA (V.O.)
Tell him you’ve never seen the
Godfather and you’d love him to explain it to you.
In a Ken Mojo Dojo Casa House, Ken Kingsley sits with Barbie Sharon in front of one of the giant TVs talking over the movie.
BARBIE ISSA
Are you watching the Godfather?
KEN KINGSLEY It’s the “Godfather.”
BARBIE ISSA I’ve never seen it!
90.
