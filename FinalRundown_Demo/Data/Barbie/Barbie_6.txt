’s. The room we see resembles a 1950’s kitchen. She’s working on something - her sewing machine is out, and there are scraps of paper and cloth all over the kitchen table.
56.

 1950 WOMAN
Don’t worry, you’re safe here.
BARBIE MARGOT (looking around)
What is this place?
1950 WOMAN (laughing at herself)
I always find that I think best at kitchen tables. Tea?
BARBIE MARGOT Yes, please.
The woman hands her the cup, which Barbie Margot brings to her lips then hesitates. A little dribbles down her chin but she is able to drink it too. She smiles, proud of herself. She feels strangely comfortable here.
BARBIE MARGOT
So, a woman does work here.
1950 WOMAN
Oh, sweetie, we do more than work
here.
BARBIE MARGOT (comfortable)
The real world isn’t what I thought it was.
1950 WOMAN (smiling)
It never is. And isn’t that marvelous?
There is a moment that passes between them. Barbie Margot feels the woman’s gaze.
BARBIE MARGOT
What? Is it that I don’t know how
to drink tea?
1950 WOMAN No. You look different.
BARBIE MARGOT (embarrassed)
I’m not what I used to be. I used to be perfect.
57.

 1950 WOMAN
I don’t know, I think you’re just
right.
She settles down at her sewing machine and resumes her work.
BARBIE MARGOT Who... who are you?
We hear the Executives in the hallway, yelling, trying doorknobs. Barbie Margot tenses. Without looking up, the older woman indicates a closet next to the refrigerator.
1950 WOMAN
If you go through that closet,
you’ll find a stairwell down to the lobby. Just be careful of the mops and brooms.
BARBIE MARGOT Thank you... ?
1950 WOMAN (smiling)
Ruth.
BARBIE MARGOT Thank you, Ruth.
RUTH
You’re welcome, Barbie.
Barbie Margot hesitates then enters the cupboard. She pushes through the mops and brooms. The cupboard extends beyond and Barbie Margot finds herself in a narrow back stairwell.
INT. LOBBY/EXT. STREET
Barbie Margot scampers across the lobby and onto the busy street. She looks around desperately. She glances back through the glass windows. Mattel Executives sliding across the shiny, slippery lobby floor.
Barbie freezes, panicked. Gloria’s car pulls up, door opening.
GLORIA Get in!
Barbie Margot then SEES Gloria. Time slows down. It’s the “love look” completed. They see each other seeing each other.
Just then the Mattel Executives come running out of the building.
58.

 GLORIA NOW! GET IN NOW!
Barbie Margot leaps into the back seat. The door slams shut and the car screeches off.
Town cars and vans pull up. The executives scramble inside.
MATTEL CEO Follow that Barbie!
INT. GLORIA’S CAR.
Gloria drives, making crazy turns. She’s an incredible driver. Sasha in the passenger seat. Everyone is screaming.
SASHA
(so embarrassed)
God I hope nobody from school saw us put a life-size Barbie in our car. How did this even happen?!
Mattel gains on them. Gloria does some crazy amazing driving. GLORIA
I don’t know!
SASHA
How are you here? You’re like, an
idea.
BARBIE MARGOT A GREAT idea.
GLORIA
So, I’ve been a little lonely
lately and I found the Barbies we used play with --
59.
 SASHA
I thought we gave those away!
GLORIA
And I started playing and
making drawings like we used to do together because I thought it would be fun and joyful--
BARBIE MARGOT (she understands)
But it wasn’t, was it?
GLORIA
No, because I started feeling sad
and weird and then the drawings got sad and weird...
(MORE)

 GLORIA (CONT’D)
and maybe because I couldn’t be
like you I ended up making you like me?
BARBIE MARGOT
Did any of these drawings by chance
have thoughts of death and cellulite?
GLORIA
YES! IRREPRESSIBLE THOUGHTS OF
DEATH BARBIE!
OH MY GOD!
BARBIE MARGOT
GLORIA And CELLULITE!
BARBIE MARGOT I came for YOU!
SASHA What?!
GLORIA YOU came for ME!
BARBIE MARGOT Those were YOUR memories!
CUT BACK to earlier images of mother and daughter, but this time we see Gloria’s experience, the joy of participating in Sasha’s childhood and the pain of Sasha inevitably moving away as she grows up.
BACK to THE CAR:
SASHA
What? Are you two, like, Shining???
GLORIA
No, it’s nothing like THAT!
SASHA
Are you Shining with a REAL Barbie?
GLORIA
No! Well, I mean, kind of... YES!
Gloria makes a crazy, screeching turn. (This should feel like the chase in Bullitt!)
SASHA
I don’t even know where to start
with this wishing a Barbie to life crap.
60.

 GLORIA
Listen, I’m just a boring Mom with
a boring job and a daughter who hates me. Can you blame me for wanting a little fun?
Gloria checks the rearview mirror. The Mattel cars flanking.
GLORIA
I’m going to have to lose these
chuckleheads.
She makes another crazy turn: clearly Gloria is NOT boring.
Mom!
SASHA
Everyone slides over, Barbie Margot falling. Gloria rights the car, Barbie Margot climbs back up, her hair a mess.
BARBIE MARGOT (shaking her head)
I think I owe you ladies an apology. I thought Barbie had made the Real World better, but the Real World is forever and irrevocably messed up!
GLORIA
Well the real world isn’t perfect,
but you inspired ME!
BARBIE MARGOT (depressed)
But I love women, I want to help women.
SASHA
Oh, come off it, everybody hates
women. Women hate women and men hate women. It’s the thing we can all agree on.
BARBIE MARGOT (horrified)
Is that true?
GLORIA SASHA It’s complicated... hate is a Wake up Mom!
strong word.
Two cars appear on either side. The Mattel executives yelling, but we can’t hear anything they’re saying through their tinted windows.
61.

 GLORIA
I am WIDE awake Sasha!
Gloria turns the wheel smashing into the side of a median strip, sending them skidding.
SASHA
MOM! Where did you learn to drive
like this?
GLORIA There was this guy...
SASHA Was it dad?
GLORIA (vague)
Yeah... yeah it was dad.
Gloria does a crazy reverse, Tokyo Drift thing right into a hidden alley. Everyone quiets as the Mattel vans drive by, not seeing them.
GLORIA
I can’t hold them off forever.
BARBIE MARGOT (suddenly)
WAIT! I have an idea! Can you get us to Venice Beach?!
EXT. VENICE BEACH. 20 MINUTES LATER They roller blade, frantically.
GLORIA Where are we going?!
BARBIE MARGOT
Barbie Land! We’ll be safe there!
SASHA
WHAT?! Mom, are you really going to
let Barbie take you and your tween daughter to an imaginary land?
GLORIA
Yes and you know why? Because I
never get to do anything. I didn’t even go on that cruise I won at your school raffle because I didn’t have enough vacation days and your dad is allergic to sun.
62.

 SASHA
What about Dad? We can’t just leave
him!
GLORIA He’ll be fine.
CUT to Nerdy Well Meaning Dad, in sandals and socks, learning Spanish from an app.
NERDY WELL MEANING DAD (into his phone, loud)
Boligrafos.
APP Muy bien!
BACK to our group.
SASHA Yeah, he’ll be fine.
BARBIE MARGOT Ready for fun! Here we go!
TRANSPORTATION MONTAGE
AND: We replay some of the various vehicles. First is Snowmobile. Cute winter wear!
SASHA
Where are we! How did we get into
these clothes?
BARBIE MARGOT
(a twinkle in her eye)
How did you get into this vehicle?
GLORIA (looking down)
When I was a kid, I lost these boots and my mom wouldn’t let me buy a whole new Barbie just to replace the boots!
BARBIE MARGOT They look so good on you.
GLORIA Why thank you!
Sasha does an eye roll.
63.
 
 Camper. They’re all chilling in lawn chairs.
GLORIA
(admiring Barbie Margot)
She was always my favorite Barbie. BARBIE MARGOT
And you are my favorite human! Tandem Bike. It’s now a three seater!
GLORIA
Don’t tell him, but I never got a
Ken.
BARBIE MARGOT That’s because Ken is totally
superfluous!
They all crack up - Barbie Margot and Gloria are real pals. Rocket.
BARBIE MARGOT
Women hold all major positions of
power, control all the money, basically everything men do in your world, women do in ours.
SASHA (bending a little)
I mean, that sounds kind of cool.
Boat. Sasha is laughing as they take the waves in the speed boat. The experience, as bizarre as it is, can’t help but delight her. Sasha then regards her mother regarding her:
GLORIA Look! Dolphins!
EXT. BARBIE LAND. BARBIE CAR. DAY
Barbie, Gloria and Sasha cruise in the Barbie Car. Indigo Girls “Closer to Fine” playing on the radio, as always
BARBIE MARGOT (singing)
I went to the doctor / I went to the mountain.
SASHA WHAT IS THIS SONG?!
GLORIA (also singing)
I went to the doctor / I went to the mountain.
BARBIE MARGOT (going on)
... and we have a female president!
64.

 BARBIE MARGOT And it’s fun and work and
friendship and female 24/7.
SASHA
Do giant hands come in and play
with you?
BARBIE MARGOT What? No. That’s crazy.
CUT BACK TO: VENICE BEACH. REAL WORLD
Mattel Executives talk to locals on the Boardwalk who tell them what they saw earlier.
MUSCULAR VENICE BEACH PERSON (pointing indistinctly)
A blonde, a brunette and a tween roller bladed in that direction...
MATTEL CEO (ominous)
The first step is always rollerblading.
AARON DINKINS MATTEL CEO
(he’s tagged along) They’ve gone to Barbie Land.
Excuse me, sir? Oh no.
AARON DINKINS
MATTEL CEO
And she brought humans there with
her. This could mean extremely weird things for our world.
Like what?
AARON DINKINS
MATTEL CEO
Like nothing any of our collective
imaginations COULD EVER DREAM UP. Aaron Dinkins looks peculiar, trying to imagine.
EXECUTIVE #1
A podcast hosted by two wise trees?
Or a choir of two thousand young fathers...
65.

 MATTEL CEO Not even CLOSE.
(to the others)
We’ve got to get to Barbie Land! GO! Find some blades. Just pick a direction and run!
They scatter.
EXT. BARBIE LAND. DAY.
Gloria and Sasha are totally impressed by the beauty of BARBIE LAND as they drive by the ocean in Barbie’s convertible.
BARBIE MARGOT (soaking it all in)
I can feel my heels lifting already. Yes, this is what I was supposed to do. Bring you back here!
GLORIA (so happy)
It feels right!
It does!
BARBIE MARGOT
They pass the BEACH. Kens are playing volleyball a la Top Gun and the Barbies are cheering (reverse of beginning).
BARBIE MARGOT That’s strange...
Also Kens race on the beach and hug triumphantly in the surf (a la Rocky III). Barbie Issa hands a Ken a beer.
BARBIE ISSA Incoming brewski beer--
(she makes plane sounds)
BARBIE MARGOT
Uh, so that’s our president with
the beer. And the cheering squad... is the supreme court?
BARBIE ISSA
This is so much better than being
President!!
BARBIE MARGOT Something’s weird today.
66.

 A Ken Mermaid leaps out of the surf and waves. You don’t think that’s a thing? Check this out:
Hi Barbie!
KEN MERMAID
BARBIE MARGOT (slightly taken aback))
Oh... OK. Hi Ken.
Barbie Mermaid emerges and hands the Ken Mermaid a beer.
BARBIE MERMAID
Here have a brewski beer! My big
guy is thirsty!
BARBIE MARGOT
Huh.
(shaking it off)
OK. Wait until you see my Dreamhouse. Everything I’ve bought and owned will totally inspire you. We’ll change clothes again!
They pass the Capitol.
BARBIE MARGOT And that’s the Capitol!
SASHA It’s pink!!
And finally they pass Barbie Mt. Rushmore, but now instead of Barbies it’s... horses?!
BARBIE MARGOT (frowns)
Huh.
EXT. BARBIE MARGOT’S DREAMHOUSE
They drive through the neighborhood.
BARBIE MARGOT
And these are the Dreamhouses! This
is where I live.
As they arrive in the cul-de-sac, Gloria exclaims.
GLORIA (still in awe)
You can see through the houses!
67.

 SASHA
So each Barbie has their own house?
Where do the Kens stay?
BARBIE MARGOT (this has never occurred
to her before) I don’t know!
GLORIA (nerding out)
I had that treehouse! I saved up my allowance to buy it.
A Ken sits on the swing and waves to them. Barbie cocks her head. Strange.
They pass a giant Hummer with flames--
BARBIE MARGOT
I’ve never seen a car like that
before... what happened here?
She finally takes in the full transformation - There are mini- fridges everywhere, that poster of dogs playing poker, video games, BIG TVs playing horse footage, Doritos, Mini
basketball hoops & arcade games, chin-up bars in the
doorways, foosball, pool, ping pong, air hockey, it’s all Ken all the time, empowered through some strange game of telephone with the real world...
Some of them have beards, some mustaches, a couple have goatees. Every Ken is there, including Ken Simu. This embrace of a Real World cartoon masculinity seems to have united them. A now bearded Ken Ryan Gosling sporting a mink coat is in the middle of a monologue. All the Kens listen, rapt.
KEN RYAN GOSLING (rotating through all the
man-activities)
At first I thought the Real World was run by men, and then for one minute I thought it was run by horses, but now I realize that horses are just men-extenders. So are cars, buildings, airplanes, EVERYTHING! Everything exists just to expand and elevate the presence of MEN!
KEN KINGSLEY That’s amazing!
68.
   
 BARBIE MARGOT (O.S.) Ken, what have you done?! What are
you wearing?!
The Kens turn to see Barbie Margot, Gloria and Sasha. Ken Ryan Gosling is secretly thrilled she showed up. He’d been wa
