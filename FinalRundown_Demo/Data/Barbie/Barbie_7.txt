nting her to see what he was capable of. He tries to cover with nonchalance.
KEN RYAN GOSLING
Don’t question it. Just roll with
it tiny baby.
BARBIE MARGOT Don’t call me “baby!”
He’s hurt, but instead of admitting it, now he’s going to go full-out aggressive and posturing.
KEN RYAN GOSLING
Ok, what about Mini Baby like this
mini-fridge?
Ken Ryan Gosling opens the door to his mini-fridge and grabs a beer. Laughter from the Kens. Allan sits with the Kens on a leather couch and looks miserable.
BARBIE MARGOT This is MY Dreamhouse.
KEN RYAN GOSLING This is no longer “Barbie’s
Dreamhouse,” this shall henceforth be known as “Ken’s Mojo Dojo Casa House.”
SASHA
You don’t have to say “Dojo” and
“House.”
GLORIA And “Casa.”
KEN RYAN GOSLING
But ya do. Because it feels so
good. Try it. Mojo. Dojo. Casa. House.
Gloria and Sasha begin to repeat it back to Ken Ryan Gosling. Barbie Margot shushes them to stop as Ken laughs maniacally.
EXT/INT. MATTEL SHIPPING WAREHOUSE. REAL WORLD. DAY People loading Ken Mojo Dojo Casa Houses onto forklifts.
69.

 MATTEL CEO (O.S.) (yelling into his phone)
Give it to me straight - how weird is it?
WAREHOUSE EMPLOYEE These Mojo Dojo Casa Houses are
literally flying off the shelves! The kids are CLAMORING for them! Ken is on t-shirts, mugs, it’s the number one tattoo. Warner Bros has started auditions for the Ken movie. Which is already a blockbuster hit!
EXT. VENICE BEACH. REAL WORLD. DAY
All the Mattel execs are roller blading. The CEO reacting to the news on his phone.
MATTEL CEO
It’s happening. That thing we
could never imagine. If we don’t get my Words Lady -
AARON DINKINS
- Executive Assistant -
MATTEL CEO
Executive Words Lady and someone
who is probably her daughter back here and close the portal, our world could be altered forever.
EXECUTIVE #2
But what does it matter if it’s
Barbie or Ken? The money is pouring in!
MATTEL CEO
Shame on you, Executive Number 2!
Do you think I spent my entire life in board rooms because of a bottom line?!
They all look away not wanting to answer this.
MATTEL CEO
No! I got into this business
because of little girls and their dreams! In the least creepy way possible!
(back to panic)
BLADE FASTER! Time is running out!
70.

 EXT. BARBIE MARGOT’S DREAMHOUSE
Ken Ryan Gosling swings a golf club through some plastic flowers in the yard. Barbie Margot reacts.
KEN RYAN GOSLING
Look, I’m just hanging down with my bro-homies having a brewski beer in
my Mojo Dojo Casa House. (to Barbie Margot)
You can stay here if you want as my bride-wife or my long-term-low- commitment-distance girlfriend. Now, brewski beer me.
BARBIE MARGOT
I will NOT brewski beer you.
KEN RYAN GOSLING That’s fine. I mean, without you
Barbies running things, we can do our hair however we like--
We see Kens with crazy patches of beard on their faces.
KEN KINGSLEY I have hats.
Barbie Emma enters in a French Maid outfit, Barbie Hari in a Naughty Schoolgirl outfit.
BARBIE EMMA (brainwashed)
How are my hungry boys! Who wants snacks?
BARBIE MARGOT
Barbie, I’m so glad to see you! Can
you believe what’s happening?!
BARBIE EMMA (body snatched)
I know! Isn’t it great?
BARBIE HARI (to the men)
Does anyone need a brewski-beer?
BARBIE MARGOT
What are you doing? You’re a
doctor!
71.
 
 BARBIE HARI
Being a doctor was stressful and a
lot of work. I’m happy being helpful decoration.
BARBIE EMMA
And Allan likes to help me give the
Kens foot-massages.
ALLAN
No, I don’t. I don’t like that.
Allan looks totally freaked out by what’s happening. Barbie Sharon and Barbie Ana sit on a leather couch rubbing a Ken’s feet.
We do!
BARBIES
KEN RYAN GOSLING
I’m so blotto-faced day-drunk.
Kens cheer in agreement.
KEN KINGSLEY Ditto same-same that!
BARBIE EMMA
I like not having to make any
decisions. It’s like a spa day for my brain, forever.
BARBIE MARGOT What’s wrong with her?!
KEN RYAN GOSLING Nothing. We just explained the impeccable immaculate seamless
garment of logic that is Patriarchy and she crumbled.
GLORIA (figuring it out)
Oh my God. It’s like in the 1500s with the indigenous people and small pox. They had no defenses against it.
KEN RYAN GOSLING (no idea what she’s
talking about) Yeah!!
Ken Ryan Gosling climbs up onto the roof of his Hummer.
72.
 
 KEN RYAN GOSLING Buckle up, babe, because Barbie
Land is now Ken Land and it’ll be just like Century City in Los Angeles. Because they have it figured out in Century City.
(describing a delicacy)
The minute you get out of your car, you’re like I can’t believe how great this place is.
Ken Simu nods vigorously. He LOVES it!
BARBIE MARGOT
No! They don’t. They don’t have it
figured out in Century City. Because we failed them.
With sudden, personal intensity, almost crying, based on a life-time of feeling like a second class citizen:
KEN RYAN GOSLING
No, you failed me! Out there I was
a SOMEBODY! I walked down the street and people respected me just for WHO I AM.
(to the Kens)
One lady even asked me for the time.
73.
 NO WAY!
KEN SIMU
KEN RYAN GOSLING WAY! Except for these dumb
technicalities like MBAs and medical degrees and, I don’t know, swim lessons, I could have ruled THAT world.
He attempts to slide down the hood of the Hummer but his mink sticks to the metal and he moves at a glacial pace. Finally landing on the ground:
KEN RYAN GOSLING
But here I don’t need any of those
things. Here I’m just a DUDE! AND THAT IS ENOUGH!
He raises a remote with a sense of triumph and switches the channel on giant gross TV that has, until this point, been playing romantic horse footage.

 BARBIE RITU (O.S.) (brainwashed)
This has been such an exciting day! EXT. CAPITOL STEPS. ON THE TV. DAY
A Newswoman (Barbie Ritu) interviews Ken Scott.
KEN SCOTT
It sure has! And please call me Mr.
Ken President Prime Minister Man.
BARBIE RITU
Let’s recap all the amazing changes
and innovations thanks to the Kens! CUT TO: THEATRE
Nobel prize ceremony. All the contestants are the judges are Ken.
ANNOUNCER

INT. BARBIE KEN OVAL OFFICE. DAY

Kens and all
his prize.
74.
  
 EXT. MOJO DOJO CASA HOUSE. SAME
Ken Ryan Gosling turns triumphantly to Barbie Margot, but also kind of wanting her approval.
BARBIE MARGOT
You can’t do this. This is Barbie Land. The Barbies worked hard and
dreamed hard to make it everything it is. You can’t just UNDO it in a day!
KEN RYAN GOSLING Literally and figuratively watch
me.
(echoing Barbie from
earlier in the movie)
Now, if you’ll excuse me. This is MY Mojo Dojo Casa House. Not Barbie’s Mojo Dojo Casa House. Right?
Barbie Margot looks devastated.
KEN RYAN GOSLING (quiet and sincere)
See how it feels? It’s not fun, is it?
ALL THE KENS It’s boy’s night!
A catch in his throat, this almost hurts him to say:
KEN RYAN GOSLING Every night is boy’s night.
Ken Ryan Gosling feels for her, but then puts on sunglasses to hide his emotion. Then he puts sunglasses on top of his sunglasses and walks away. Cold as ice.
EXT. CUL-DE-SAC. DAY
Barbie Margot runs from the house screaming. Gloria and Sasha follow. As she reaches the lawn, clothes and accessories come raining down. Ken is tossing all her stuff off the third floor.
KEN RYAN GOSLING
And take your lady fashions with
you!
He identifies each clothing set as it flies through the air.
75.

 KEN RYAN GOSLING
Take your “Celebrate Disco” bell
bottoms, take your “Ice Capades Pretty Practice Suit and Dazzling Show Skirt”...
Gloria surreptitiously picks up a few great pieces. GLORIA
These are archival!
KEN RYAN GOSLING ...your “Pajama Jam in Amsterdam”
set AND your “Pretty Paisley Palazzo Pants” and get OUT.
He is angry but he still loves all the clothes and obsessively calls them by their proper names, of course.
BARBIE MARGOT NOT THE PALAZZOS!!!
Ken Ryan Gosling collapses in a pool of emotion. Barbie Margot runs crying. Gloria and Sasha follow. Gloria tries to comfort her. Barbie Margot turns on Gloria, angry:
BARBIE MARGOT
Why did you wish me to your messed
up world using your complicated human thoughts and feelings?! Barbie Land was perfect before and I was perfect before!
GLORIA
I’m so sorry I wasn’t trying to do
anything--
Sasha steps in, defending Gloria, who is touched.
SASHA
Don’t apologize -- Don’t blame my
Mom. Maybe you wished us? Maybe it’s your fault, Barbie.
BARBIE MARGOT
I didn’t wish anything! I’ve never
wanted anything to change.
GLORIA
Well, honey, that’s life. It’s all
change.
76.
 
 BARBIE MARGOT
Well that’s just terrifying. I
don’t want that. Not MY life. I’m just going sit here and wait and hope that one of the more leadership oriented Barbies snaps out of it and does something about this whole mess.
Barbie Margot drops listlessly into a sitting position, tips over and lies flat like a doll.
GLORIA
I really understand this
feeling. It’s basically like being a human person all the time--
BARBIE MARGOT
JUST LEAVE ME HERE! Go back to your messed up world and
leave me to mine.
SASHA
So you’re just going to give up? I
almost felt bad for you, but you are exactly what I thought you were.
GLORIA
Come on, honey, let’s go
SASHA BARBIE MARGOT How do we even-- Do everything we did,
reversed.
Gloria and Sasha walk away.
SASHA
She doesn’t deserve you.
Barbie Margot is now actually face down on the lawn.
BARBIE MARGOT
This is the lowest I’ve ever been.
Emotionally AND physically.
A COMMERCIAL ON TV. It’s all bright and happy except for the dolls are really going through it. They look wrecked and sad.
ADVERTISING VOICE
Ok, kids! It’s time to run out and
get the NEW Depression Barbie! (MORE)
CUT TO:
77.

 ADVERTISING VOICE (CONT’D) She wears sweatpants all day and
night, she spent seven hours today on Instagram looking at her estranged best friend’s engagement photos while eating a family sized bag of Starbursts and now her jaw is KILLING her and she's going to watch the BBC's Pride and Prejudice for the seventh time until she falls asleep. (Anxiety, panic attacks and OCD sold separately).
EXT. BARBIE KEN LAND STREET. DAY.
Weird Barbie patrols in a vehicle version of her house, constructed from abandoned Barbie cars. It’s kind of like a tank, very Road Warrior.
It rumbles past a Ken taking down “Barbie Way” and putting up a “Ken Avenue Boulevard Road Mews” sign. They screech to a halt beside a catatonic Barbie Margot:
WEIRD BARBIE Got a live one here!
Earring Magic Ken and Barbie Video Girl pick Barbie Margot up. From Barbie Margot’s point of view we see Weird Barbie.
BARBIE MARGOT I’m like you now. Ugly and
unwanted.
WEIRD BARBIE Thanks, kid.
Barbie Margot is lifted into the amazing, cock-eyed vehicle. EXT. TRANSPORTATION MONTAGE
TANDEM BIKE. With the CEO at the front and Aaron Dinkens in the back, Mattel rides a 12 person tandem bike on their journey to Barbie Land!
MATTEL CEO (shouting to the group)
Isn’t this great!! Wait until you see the boat!
INT/EXT. BARBIE CAR. OPEN ROAD.
Gloria and Sasha are driving down the Barbie highway in Barbie’s car. Gloria and Sasha (!!!) sing at the top of their lungs to the Indigo Girls.
78.
 
 GLORIA AND SASHA
“I went to the doctor / I went to
the mountains / I looked to the children / I drank from the fountains...”
Sasha looks almost wistfully at the retreating landscape of Barbie Land.
Suddenly the song on the radio is cut out by a needle scratch. Gloria frowns. A Ken comes over the airwaves.
KEN RADIO DJ
We interrupt this broadcast to
bring you our NEW radio station KKEN 107.5. Playing Ken’s favorite song over and over again!
And then suddenly Matchbox 20’s “Push” erupts from the speakers. Allan pops up in the backseat:
ALLAN
TURN THIS SONG OFF FOR CHRISTSAKE!
Gloria and Sasha scream their heads off and Allan screams at their screaming. So much screaming! They skid off the road, crashing down a hill, flipping over a few times and landing upright on another road. (SAME SHOT AS THE FIRST TIME.) Except for this time, the car lands with no one in it, and ONE second later, right beside the car, in the same configuration, land Gloria, Sasha, & Allan.
MATCHBOX 20 (singing)
“I want to push you around. Well, I will, well, I will...”
Still hysterical, getting to their feet: SASHA
Who are you?!
ALLAN I’m Allan!
GLORIA
You ARE Allan. That’s great!
ALLAN
Don’t tell the Kens, I’
