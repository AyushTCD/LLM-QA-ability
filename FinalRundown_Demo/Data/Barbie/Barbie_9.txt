e now de-brainwashed Barbie Issa sits beside him, feigning total interest.
KEN KINGSLEY
Oh my god you’ve never seen The
Godfather? The movie is a rich blend of Coppola’s aesthetic genius and a triumph of Robert Evans and the architecture of the 70’s studio system--
She nods and smiles and while he’s busy blathering on about the movie, Barbie Margot and Weird Barbie gently “kidnap” Barbie Sharon, and lead her to Gloria who does another version of her speech.
GLORIA
You have to reject men’s advances
without damaging their egos, because if you say yes to them, you’re a tramp, and if you say no to them, you’re a prude.
Barbie Sharon blinks, awakened.
BARBIE SHARON
I don’t want to touch a foot.
GLORIA No, you don’t.
SASHA (V.O.) Be confused about money.
Now it’s Barbie Sharon helping! She sits with a a bunch of financial documents.
BARBIE SHARON
Oh, I just have all my money in a
Savings account--
KEN SCOTT (opening a briefcase)
That’s totally wrong. You need treasury bonds, corporate bonds. CDs.
BARBIE SHARON No one has CDs anymore!
KEN SCOTT
Oh sweetheart you are just so cute
when you’re confused. (MORE)
91.

 KEN SCOTT (CONT’D) But no, not music CDs, CD stands
for Certificate of Deposit which is issued by the bank to...
They steal away HIS Barbie (Barbie Emma, in her maid outfit) and deprogram her.
BARBIE EMMA What am I wearing?
And now Barbie Emma browses through albums while Ken Ncuti puts on a record, with Barbie Ana by his side.
BARBIE EMMA
I know what I like, but I don’t
know albums--
KEN NCUTI (abandoning Barbie Ana)
Oh, my God, you’ve never heard of Pavement?!
BARBIE EMMA It’s got a pretty cover--
KEN NCUTI
Stephen Malkmus really harnessed
the acerbic talk singing of Lou Reed with post punk influences such as Wire and The Fall.
GLORIA (V.O.)
And then there are some classics of
the trade.
Barbie Ana pretends she’s drowning, by just lying down by the
side of the ocean. A Ken leans down to rescue her.
BARBIE ANA (batting her eyelashes)
You might have to give me mouth to mouth.
And again the liberated Barbies steal away Barbie Hari. Gloria ranting. Barbie Hari snapping out of it:
Then she executes the classic glasses gag:
BARBIE HARI
Gee I am so awkward and don’t feel
pretty at all and will anyone ever like me?
92.

 KEN RYAN GOSLING
May I...?
He takes off her glasses for her.
KEN RYAN GOSLING
There! Now I can see your beautiful
face!
GLORIA (V.O.)
And then there’s pretending to be
terrible at every sport, ever.
CUT TO: Helpful Sports Montage! Barbie Sharon pretends to not be able to hit a golf ball. Ken Scott approaches, wraps his arms around her:
KEN SCOTT Here let me show you--
Barbie Alexandra tennis swing. Ken Kingsley arm wrap.
KEN KINGSLEY Here let me show you--
Barbie Hari baseball swing. Ken Simu arm wrap.
KEN SIMU Here let me show you--
Barbie Ana pulls the arrow back. Ken Ncuti arm wrap.
KEN NCUTI Here let me show you --
All the Kens at once, maybe in a “Team Photo” type thing:
KENS
Here let us show you!
BARBIE MARGOT (V.O.) We’ll do this until every single
Barbie is deprogrammed and ready to take back Barbie Land.
INT. WEIRD BARBIE’S WEIRDHOUSE
The place is now bustling with Barbies who are back to themselves. It’s alive with chatter and planning. Weird Barbie does a taxi whistle to get their attention.
93.

 WEIRD BARBIE (to the room)
Tomorrow the Kens are going to vote to change the constitution but we have to get there first.
SASHA
The final stage of our plan: To
turn the Kens against each other. Now that they think they have power over you, you make them question whether they have enough power over each other.
CLOSE on Barbie Margot. A hand applies make-up to her face. It’s Gloria.
BARBIE MARGOT
What if this doesn’t work? What if
he doesn’t... like me anymore?
GLORIA He likes you...
BARBIE MARGOT But he was really upset...
GLORIA
Because he likes you. And deep down
he knows you don’t feel the same way.
BARBIE MARGOT
I still don’t want to hurt him.
GLORIA
He took your house. He brainwashed
your friends. He wants to control the government...
BARBIE MARGOT Ok true. Right.
(laughs)
It’s like I’m a woman already...
GLORIA Welcome.
BARBIE MARGOT
Is this what it’s really like?
They share a rueful smile as Gloria finishes.
94.
 
 Barbie Margot walks into the room of Barbies. They all smile at her. She’s “Stereotypical Barbie Perfect” again.
BARBIE MARGOT I’m ready. Here we go!
EXT. KEN’S MOJO DOJO CASA HOUSE
Barbie rings the bell. Ken Ryan Gosling sees her, pretends he doesn’t, noisily prepares himself, and then fakes being shocked to see her. It’s a lot.
KEN RYAN GOSLING Oh... hey. You’ve caught me
reading.
Hey. I’ve been thinking.
Uh huh.
BARBIE MARGOT Ken Land is--
BARBIE MARGOT Kendom-
BARBIE MARGOT Land of--
KEN RYAN GOSLING Kendom--
KEN RYAN GOSLING Kendom Land--
KEN RYAN GOSLING The Free and Men--
BARBIE MARGOT KEN RYAN GOSLING
BARBIE MARGOT Right. Well, this place--
Uh huh--
KEN RYAN GOSLING
BARBIE MARGOT
Is really great. I’ve never seen
the Barbies so happy--
KEN RYAN GOSLING
They’ve done a great job cheering.
BARBIE MARGOT
Yeah, and the Kens really are
better at ruling than the Barbies are--
KEN RYAN GOSLING (like it’s nothing)
We just took Patriarchy and made it Patriarchy.
95.

 BARBIE MARGOT KEN RYAN GOSLING (confused but moving Yes?
along)
Right and--
BARBIE MARGOT
And... I’m ready to be your long-
term-distance-low-commitment-casual girlfriend if you’ll still have me?
KEN RYAN GOSLING (clearly into this idea)
Um... will you just hold on for one second.
Ken Ryan Gosling retreats into his house and out of view.
SUBLIME! Returning to Barbie.
KEN RYAN GOSLING (O.S.)
Yay! She hops inside.
BARBIE MARGOT
KEN RYAN GOSLING
I don’t know. I’m going to have to
think about it.
Please?
BARBIE MARGOT
KEN RYAN GOSLING
Fine. Come inside and I can play
the guitar at you.
INT. KEN’S MOJO DOJO CASA HOUSE
Ken Ryan Gosling plays guitar on the couch while staring at Barbie Margot who listens patiently.
KEN RYAN GOSLING (to Barbie Margot)
“I want to Push you down, well I will well I will.”
EXT. BARBIE LAND. BEACH. NIGHT
4 Hours Later and he’s still going. Now on the dunes. It’s a beach party with all the Kens and their Barbies. All the Barbies pretend to be brainwashed, and all the Kens play guitar at them. Yes, it’s like 20 guitars. And one drum set.
96.

 KENS (to Barbies)
“I want to Push you down, well I will well I will.”
BARBIE MARGOT (V.O.) This is the final stage of our
plan. Give them their dream come true...
GLORIA (V.O.)
And at the peak of their happiness,
when they think you actually care about this song...
SASHA (V.O.) You take it all away.
Margot looks across to Barbie Alexandra, who nods - it’s time. Then Barbie Margot looks at her phone and giggles.
KEN RYAN GOSLING (immediately insecure)
Who... who are you texting?
BARBIE MARGOT (feigning innocence)
Huh?
KEN RYAN GOSLING Who are you texting?
Anyone who asks that question twice has already lost all power.
BARBIE MARGOT
No one.
He snatches the phone.
KEN RYAN GOSLING (reading)
Ken!
BARBIE MARGOT Sorry, one sec...
We follow Barbie Margot and move throughout the Barbie/Ken couples at the party, all playing their guitars at their Barbies.
Barbie Margot approaches Ken Simu who also plays guitar and sings Matchbox 20 at Barbie Alexandra.
97.

 BARBIE MARGOT
That’s a beautiful song you’re
playing. Did you write it?
KEN SIMU
Yes. Want to sit here and watch me
do it while staring into your eyes uncomfortably for four and a half minutes?
BARBIE MARGOT I’d love to.
Ken Ryan Gosling observes this, enraged. He smashes his guitar into the sand but it doesn’t break.
And now the other Barbies do similar things, walking across the sand from their Kens to engage with opposing Kens.
The Kens trusted!
EXT/INT.
BARBIE MARGOT (V.O.) You play on their egos and their
petty jealousies and you turn them against each other. While they’re fighting, we take back Barbie Land.

are open to the world, they can all see and talk to each other. It’s all very kid-like.
Gosling, Ken Kingsley and Ken Ncuti sit on the edges houses with their feet dangling. Because the houses
KEN NCUTI (from his house)
Does the title of long term- distance-low-commitment-casual girlfriend mean NOTHING?!
KEN RYAN GOSLING (from his house)
This has gone too far!
KEN NCUTI What do we do?!
KEN KINGSLEY (from his house)
We beach every individual one of them OFF!
98.

 KEN RYAN GOSLING No. We go to war!
KEN KINGSLEY Against the Barbies?
KEN RYAN GOSLING Against the Kens.
KEN KINGSLEY But we are the Kens.
KEN RYAN GOSLING The other Kens.
KEN KINGSLEY
Well we should probably call them
something else so it doesn’t get confusing.
KEN RYAN GOSLING No, we’ll know what we mean.
KEN KINGSLEY
When we’re on the battlefield and you say, “Ken at four o’clock!” I won’t know if you mean us Kens or
the other Kens.
KEN RYAN GOSLING Because, my dudes, we attack at 10
o’clock, to take advantage of the morning waves.
KEN NCUTI
But not so early so we all get to
sleep in. Right.
KEN RYAN GOSLING
KEN KINGSLEY
What will we fight with? We have no
guns.
KEN RYAN GOSLING
Tennis racquets and volley balls.
KEN NCUTI And slap fights!
KEN RYAN GOSLING And beach offs!
99.

 INT./EXT. MOJO DOJO CASA HOUSE. DAWN
In his bed, Ken Ryan Gosling is already awake, singing.
Then he and the other Kens mink up and walk towards battle, Ryan still singing. Think “The Warriors.”
The song continues as...
EXT. BARBIE LAND. BEACH. DAWN
They come in on paddle boats, Ken Ryan Gosling and Ken Kingsley leading the charge, paddling furiously, trying to look dignified in their arm floaties.
The other Kens, led by Ken Simu, are waiting on the dunes mounted on hobby-horses.
KEN RYAN GOSLING (unhinged screaming)
I’ll see you on the Malibu beach!
As they rush the beach in their trunks, they’re also hitting volleyballs and making sand castles. Maybe a game of Kadima?
KEN KINGSLEY The water is cold!
Slo-mo sand being kicked in Ken’s faces. EXT. ROOF OF WEIRD BARBIE’S. MORNING
All the Barbies, Barbie Margot, Weird Barbie, Gloria, Sasha, and the rejected Barbies and Kens look over Barbie Land.
GLORIA
And now they destroy themselves.
WEIRD BARBIE Should we go restore our
constitution?
BARBIE EMMA
Good idea. EXT. BARBIE LAND. BEACH
BACK TO THE BEACH. The executives from Mattel in their suits appear amidst the Kens on the beach.
MATTEL CEO
This is a real hornet’s nest in
here.
100.

 Aaron Dinkins is hit in the head with a volleyball.
Ow!
AARON DINKINS
Mattel Executive #1 laughs and then is suddenly and violently shot in the arm in a real Saving Private Ryan way. He crumples on the sand. Everyone looks at each other.
MATTEL EXECUTIVE #1 Did I get shot? Are there real
weapons here?
MATTEL CEO (not convincing)
No?
EXT. BARBIE LAND. BEACH. INTERCUT
The Kens continue to do “battle” with Ken Ryan Gosling singing his heart out.
This transitions into a “dream ballet” in a white space. The Kens dance in an expression of frustrated masculinity, helplessness, and feeling.
It culminates in dance-off and Ken Anthem. It’s beautiful, actually. It’s broken by:
KEN! KEN!
KEN KINGSLEY
We’re back on the beach. The Kens hold hands post dream ballet, Ken Ryan Gosling still in the feeling, Ken Kingsley comes running over to him.
KEN KINGSLEY
KEN! Weren’t we supposed to vote
today?
What?
To change the constitution?!
KEN RYAN GOSLING KEN KINGSLEY
KEN RYAN GOSLING
That’s today, isn’t it?!
INT. BARBIE SUPREME COURT. BARBIE/KEN LAND. DAY
We move through the crowd of enthusiastic Barbies. “The last time I saw you you were brain washed! So were you!
101.

 You look so you without
Barbie Issa commanding.
much better not in the cheerleader costume! And the school girl outfit!”
bangs the gavel, casually and glamorously
BARBIE ISSA
OK ladies, let’s do this. All those
in favor of letting Barbie Land be Barbie Land, say “Aye!”
The Barbies all say “aye” voting to retain the constitution. Sasha grabs her mom’s hand. She has a tear running down her cheek.
Barbie Margot smiles. That’s what she wanted to show them. EXT. BARBIE DREAMHOUSE. DAY
The Kens, in musical dance pack, approach the cul-de-sac as if they’re riding horses, but they’re just galloping on foot Monty Python style...
As they arrive, they look up and down and all around to discover that the Barbies (plus Allan and Sasha and Gloria and the rejected dolls) are now occupying all the houses.
The whole aesthetic is now a combination of Mojo Dojo Casa House PLUS Dreamhouse PLUS Weirdhouse. It’s a combo-pack, which is actually the most beautiful of all.
KEN RYAN GOSLING (losing his shit)
Is it my imagination, or are these Mojo Dojo Casa Houses... dreamier???
The Barbies all step out into the open.
BARBIE ISSA (from on
