 Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 1.
A VAST SPHERE OF FIRE, the fire of a thousand suns, slowly eats the night-time desert. A line of black type appears:
PROMETHEUS STOLE FIRE FROM THE GODS AND GAVE IT TO MAN. And the sound of DOZENS OF FEET STAMPING RHYTHMICALLY...
FOR THIS HE WAS CHAINED TO A ROCK AND TORTURED FOR ETERNITY. ROILING PLASMA expands, the sound of STAMPING GROWS
OPPRESSIVE, the STAMPING FASTER and FASTER OVER-
A FACE. Gaunt, tense, EYES TIGHTLY SHUT. The face SHUDDERS- the sound CEASES AS MY EYES OPEN, STARING INTO THE CAMERA:
Peer into my soul- J. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER, aged fifty, close- cropped greying hair. The gentle sounds of bureaucracy...
SUPER TITLE: "1. FISSION"
VOICE (O.S.)
Dr Oppenheimer, as we begin, I
believe you have a statement to read into the record?
I glance down at my notes.
OPPENHEIMER Yes, your honour-
SECOND VOICE (O.S.) We’re not judges, doctor.
OPPENHEIMER No. Of course.
(I start reading)
Members of the Security Board, the so-called derogatory information in your indictment of me cannot be fairly understood except in the context of my life and work. This answer is a summary of relevant aspects of my life in more or less chronological order...
SENATE AIDE (V.O.) How long did he testify?

INT. SENATE OFFICE -- DAY (BLACK-AND-WHITE SEQUENCE)
CLOSE: on a prosperous sixty-three-year-old man, LEWIS STRAUSS, as he takes a cup of coffee from a SENATE AIDE...
SUPER TITLE: "2. FUSION"
STRAUSS
I forget. Three days, or so. The
whole hearing took a month.
SENATE AIDE An ordeal.
STRAUSS
I’ve only read the transcripts, but
who’d want to justify their whole life?
SENATE AIDE You weren’t there?
STRAUSS
As Chairman, I wasn’t allowed to
be. Are they really going to ask about it? It was years ago.
SENATE AIDE
Four years ago. Oppenheimer still
divides America- the committee will want to know where you stood.
(checks his watch) Ready?
INT. CORRIDOR, SENATE BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER (B&W) The Senate Aide leads Strauss along the corridor.
SENATE AIDE
Senator Thurmond asked me to say
not to feel you’re on trial.
STRAUSS
I didn’t, till you said that.
SENATE AIDE
Really, Mr Strauss- Admiral. STRAUSS (CONT’D)
SENATE AIDE (CONT’D) Admiral Strauss, this is a
formality. (MORE)
(CONTINUED)

 Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 3.
SENATE AIDE (CONT’D) President Eisenhower’s asked you to
be in his cabinet, the Senate has no choice but to confirm you.
They arrive at the door.
STRAUSS
And if they bring up Oppenheimer?
SENATE AIDE
When they bring up Oppenheimer,
answer honestly and no senator can deny that you did your duty. It’ll be uncomfortable...
(smiles)
Who’d want to justify their whole life?
The door to the VAST committee room opens- they enter, FLASHBULBS POPPING as PRESS and PUBLIC see Strauss.
ROBB (V.O.)
Why did you leave the United
States?
INT. ROOM 2022, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION -- DAY (COLOUR)
The room is SMALL, SHABBY. Surprised, I look up from my statement at the prosecutor, Roger ROBB. Then turn to the THREE BOARD MEMBERS (GRAY, EVANS, MORGAN).
OPPENHEIMER
I wanted to learn the new physics.
GRAY
Was there nowhere here? I thought
Berkeley had the leading theoretical physics department-
OPPENHEIMER
Sure. Once I built it. First I had
to go to Europe. I went to Cambridge to work under Patrick Blackett.
ROBB
Were you happier there than in
America?

INSERT CUT: A YOUNG ME (TWENTY-ONE) LIES IN BED STARING UP, CRYING... PARTICLES WITH THE VASTNESS OF THE STARS MOVE LIKE FIREFLIES...
OPPENHEIMER
No. I was homesick. Emotionally
immature... troubled by visions of a hidden universe...
INT. LABORATORY, CAMBRIDGE -- DAY
The young ME, frazzled demeanor, STRUGGLES with equipment.
OPPENHEIMER (V.O.) ...useless in the lab.
I drop a beaker, it SHATTERS. PATRICK BLACKETT looks over, FROWNING. He picks up an APPLE and takes a LARGE BITE.
BLACKETT (through apple)
Christ, Oppenheimer, have you had any sleep? Start again.
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER I need to go to the lecture.
BLACKETT
Why?
It’s Niels Bohr.
Blackett checks his watch- starts packing up-
BLACKETT
Damn, completely forgot. Let’s go.
I start to pack up with the other students.
BLACKETT (CONT’D) Not you. Finish coating those
plates.
I clean up as Blackett and the other students leave- one leaves an APPLE for Blackett- GREEN WITH STEM AND TINY LEAF.
I pause at a bottle: "Potassium Cyanide"... CLUMSY HANDS SHAKING, I draw CYANIDE into a syringe. I INJECT the apple...
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER (pleading)

 Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 5.
EXT. QUADRANGLE, CAMBRIDGE -- EVENING
I HURRY across the quad. A lonely figure.
BOHR (V.O.) Quantum physics isn’t a step
forward...
INT. LECTURE HALL, CAMBRIDGE -- CONTINUOUS
I sneak into the back of the auditorium. Standing, SPELLBOUND, as NIELS BOHR, a charismatic Dane, lectures.
BOHR
...It’s a new way to understand
reality. Einstein’s opened a door, now we’re peering through, seeing a world inside our world... a world of energy and paradox that not everyone can accept.
I RAISE my hand to ask a question...
INT. SENATE COMMITTEE HEARING ROOM -- DAY (B&W)
CUT TO:
Strauss sits facing the Committee, COUNSEL beside him, PRESS, CAMERAS and PUBLIC behind...
SENATOR MCGEE
Admiral Strauss, I’m interested in
your relationship with Dr J. Robert Oppenheimer. You met in 1947?
STRAUSS Correct.
SENATOR MCGEE
You were a commissioner of the
Atomic Energy Commission?
STRAUSS
I was, but I met Robert in my
capacity as board member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. After the war he was world-renowned- the great man of physics...

 Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 6.
EXT. INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY, PRINCETON -- DAY (B&W) Strauss, younger, fifty-one, bustles out of the Institute-
STRAUSS (V.O.)
...I was determined to get him to
run the Institute.
-to welcome the rail-thin figure of Oppenheimer (forty- three), emerging from a TAXI in HAT and coat, PIPE in mouth. ICONIC.
STRAUSS
Dr Oppenheimer, an honour.
OPPENHEIMER Mr Strauss.
STRAUSS
It’s pronounced 'straws'.
OPPENHEIMER 'Oh-ppenheimer', 'aw-ppenheimer'-
any way you say it they know I’m Jewish.
STRAUSS
I’m a proud member of Temple
Emmanuel- 'straws' is the Southern pronunciation. Welcome to the Institute. I think you could be very happy here.
Oh?
OPPENHEIMER
STRAUSS
Well, you’ll love the commute- the
position comes with that house for you and your wife.
Strauss points along an avenue of trees to Olden Manor...
STRAUSS (CONT’D) And your two children...
Oppenheimer nods as he follows Strauss into the Institute.
INT. INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY, PRINCETON -- CONTINUOUS (B&W)
Strauss leads Oppenheimer through the Institute.

STRAUSS
I’m a great admirer of your work.
OPPENHEIMER
You’re a physicist by training, Mr
Strauss?
STRAUSS
No, I’m not trained in physics, or
anything else. I’m a self-made man.
OPPENHEIMER
I can relate to that...
STRAUSS Really?
OPPENHEIMER (dry)
My father was one.
INT. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE, INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY -- MOMENTS LATER (B&W)
Strauss shows Oppenheimer into the well-appointed office.
STRAUSS
This would be your office.
Oppenheimer drifts to the windows- a LAWN rolls down to a POND. He spots a FIGURE- long grey hair poking from under his hat-
STRAUSS (CONT’D) I’m told he’s there most
afternoons.
The figure gently tosses a stone into the water.
STRAUSS (CONT’D)
I’ve always wondered why you didn’t
involved him in the Manhattan Project.
Oppenheimer turns to Strauss, interested.
STRAUSS (CONT’D)
The greatest scientific mind of our
time?

OPPENHEIMER
Of his time. Einstein published his
Theory of Relativity more than forty years ago, but never embraced the quantum world it revealed.
STRAUSS
'God doesn’t play dice.'
OPPENHEIMER Precisely. You never thought of
studying physics formally?
STRAUSS
I had offers. But I chose to sell
shoes.
OPPENHEIMER
Lewis Strauss was once a lowly shoe
salesman?
STRAUSS
No. Just a shoe salesman.
(opens the door) I’ll introduce you-
OPPENHEIMER
No need. I’ve known him for years.
Strauss, awkward, stays in the doorway and WATCHES...
FROM AFAR: as Oppenheimer approaches, Einstein’s HAT BLOWS off his head, unleashing a MESS OF GREY HAIR, hat rolling across the grass to where Oppenheimer SCOOPS it up, and we...
CUT TO:
INT. ROOM 2022, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION -- DAY (COLOUR) I flip a page. Continue reading my statement.
OPPENHEIMER

OPPENHEIMER (V.O.) ...you had to retool your mind to
see things hovering just out of site...
INSERT CUT: POINTS OF LIGHT MOVE LIKE SPARKS, BUT IN A WAVE.
OPPENHEIMER (V.O.) ...then you could unlock forces
never before imagined... I wipe TEARS from my eyes.
INSERT CUT: STARS. SPARKS FROM A CAMPFIRE. I PAT THE NOSE OF A HORSE IN THE DARKNESS AS I FEED IT AN APPLE.
I grow calm, my eyelids lowering...
INSERT CUT: AN APPLE- GREEN WITH STEM AND A TINY LEAF... I open MY EYES- JUMP out of bed- SCRAMBLE to dress-
EXT. QUADRANGLE, CAMBRIDGE -- MOMENTS LATER I RUN, DESPERATE, AGAINST the crowd-
INT. LABORATORY, CAMBRIDGE -- DAY
I BURST in- Blackett LOOKS UP. ANOTHER MAN has his back to me. Between them on the workbench- the POISONED APPLE...
BLACKETT You alright?
I nod awkward, trying to control my BREATHING...
BLACKETT (CONT’D)
Niels, meet J. Robert Oppenheimer.
The other man TURNS, offers his hand- Niels Bohr.
BOHR
What does the 'J' stand for?
BLACKETT Nothing, apparently.
Bohr takes me in- this strange, BREATHLESS young man... (CONTINUED)

10.
BOHR
You were at my lecture. You asked
the only good question.
BLACKETT
Nobody’s denying his insight. It’s
his labouratory skills that leave a little to be desired.
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER
I heard you give the same BOHR
lecture-
At Harvard. And you asked the same question. Why ask again?
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) I hadn’t liked your answer.
BOHR
Did you like it better yesterday?
A lot.
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER
BOHR
You can lift the rock without being
ready for the snake that’s revealed. Now, it seems, you’re ready.
Bohr picks up the POISONED APPLE from Blackett’s desk...
BOHR (CONT’D) You don’t enjoy the lab?
I shake my head. Bohr GESTICULATES with the apple as he talks- I watch it bob around- a kitten following a ball of string...
BOHR (CONT’D)
Get out of Cambridge, with its
beakers and potions. Go somewhere they’ll let you think...
(assesses me) Gottingen.
Born?
BLACKETT
BOHR
Born. Get to Germany. Study under
Max Born. Learn the ways of theory. I’ll send word.
Bohr raises the apple to take a bite- I GRAB it.

YOUNG OPPENHEIMER Wormhole.
-DROP it into the wastebasket. Blackett peers at it, curious.
BOHR
How’s your mathematics?
BLACKETT
Not good enough for the physicist
he wants to be.
BOHR
Algebra’s like sheet music. The
important thing isn’t can you read music, it’s can you hear it. Can you hear the music, Robert?
I can.
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER
SPARKS explode in WAVES, WAVES of FIRE CRASHING on a SHORE of GLASS, FLYING OVER the MEDIEVAL SPIRES of Gottingen, I watch BORN and BOHR and DIRAC, GALAXIES of PARTICLES DISPERSE and REFORM, a CUBIST PAINTING transfixes the Young Me, an ORCHESTRA plays STRAVINSKY, I read THE WASTE LAND, I WRITE FURIOUSLY at a desk, I WRITE FURIOUSLY on a chalkboard, I SMASH a glass, and ANOTHER, and ANOTHER, WATCHING the SHARDS skid across the floor, CATCHING and REFRACTING LIGHT, I watch RAINDROPS scintillate a PUDDLE, STREAM down a windowpane, I disturb the surface of a sink full of WATER, watching RIPPLES propagate and INTERFERE, I BOUNCE a ball against a corner of my room, studying its trajectory...
CUT TO:
EXT. INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY, PRINCETON -- DAY (B&W)
Strauss watches Oppenheimer hand the HAT to Einstein. Strauss checks his watch, then starts down the hill towards them. As he approaches, Einstein TURNS, walking towards Strauss with a GRIM EXPRESSION.
STRAUSS (friendly)
Albert...
Einstein PASSES without acknowledging Strauss. Strauss reaches Oppenheimer-
STRAUSS (CONT’D) What did you say to him?

OPPENHEIMER
He’s fine. Mr Strauss, there are things in my past you need to be
aware of.
STRAUSS
As Chairman of the AEC I have
access to your security file. I’ve read it. The job is yours.
OPPENHEIMER You’re not worried?
STRAUSS
After all you’ve done for your
country?
OPPENHEIMER Times change, Mr Strauss.
STRAUSS
The purpose of this Institute is to
provide a haven for independent minds. You’re the man for the job.
OPPENHEIMER
Then I’ll consider it. And I’ll see
you at the AEC meeting tomorrow. Oppenheimer turns, heads back up the hill.
STRAUSS (taken aback)
This is one of the most prestigious appointments in the country...
Oppenheimer looks back at Strauss, GRINS-
OPPENHEIMER
With a great commute. That’s why
I’m considering it.
Strauss watches him go, shaking his head.
SENATOR MCGEE (V.O.) So, Dr Oppenheimer brought your
attention to his past associations before you appointed him?
INT. SENATE COMMITTEE HEARING ROOM -- DAY (B&W)
 Yes.

about what he’d said to Einstein to sour him on me.
A few CHUCKLES from the room.
SENATOR MCGEE But later?
STRAUSS
Well, we all know what happened
later.

OPPENHEIMER (V.O.) ...where I first met Isidor Rabi...
A stocky young man, ISIDOR RABI (thirty), plonks down next to a DUTCH STUDENT who reluctantly shifts, giving him room.
RABI
A Yank lecturing on new physics?
This I have to hear- I’m an American myself.

INT. TRAIN, LEIDEN TO ZURICH -- NIGHT
I stare out the window at dark trees, steam and shadows, Rabi dumps his bags down, slumps opposite, sizes me up. Offers me an orange-
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER No, thank you.
RABI
It’s a long way to Zurich. You get
any skinnier we might lose you between the seat cushions. I’m Rabi.
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER Oppenheimer.
Rabi starts peeling his orange.
RABI
I caught your lecture on molecules.
Caught some if it- we’re a couple of New York Jews- how do you know Dutch?
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER
I thought I’d better learn it when
I got here this semester.
Rabi STOPS peeling his orange to STARE at me-
RABI
You learned Dutch in six weeks to
give a lecture on quantum mechanics?
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER
I wanted to challenge myself.
RABI
Quantum physics isn’t challenging
enough? Schvitzer.
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER Schvitzer?

Ever get the feeling our kind isn’t
entirely welcome here?
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER Physicists?
RABI Funny.
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER Sometimes. Not in the department.

know. We could publish together.
OPPENHEIMER
I have to get back to America.
HEISENBERG
Why? There’s no one there taking
quantum mechanics seriously. OPPENHEIMER
That’s exactly why.
RABI
He’s pining for the canyons of
Manhattan.
OPPENHEIMER
The canyons of New Mexico.
HEISENBERG You’re from New Mexico?
OPPENHEIMER
New York, but my brother and I have
a ranch outside of Santa Fe. That’s the America I miss right now.
HEISENBERG
Then you best go home, cowboys.
RABI

LAWRENCE
You must be Oppenheimer. I hear you
want to start a school of quantum theory.
OPPENHEIMER
I am starting it. Next door.
LAWRENCE They put you in there?
