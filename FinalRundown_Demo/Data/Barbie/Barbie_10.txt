That’s because they’re Dream Houses, mother*******.
She’s censored by a Mattel logo.
BARBIE ISSA
We’ve re-instated the constitution
of Barbie Land the way it was MEANT to be, and returned all the Barbie’s brains and autonomy.
All the Barbies cheer!
102.
 
 BARBIE ISSA
And we seriously disinfected the
houses.
KEN RYAN GOSLING
Kens!!!
They all slowly, tiredly line themselves up.
KEN KINGSLEY
Who are we attacking, sir?
The--
KEN RYAN GOSLING
Ken Ryan Gosling looks at the Barbies, triumphant, but not confrontational.
He hesitates. He looks back at the Kens who look exhausted and confused. Suddenly he sees the folly of everything. The other Kens look sheepish, as well. They look like the kids at the end of Lord of The Flies when the ship comes.
Ken Ryan Gosling starts crying and runs past Barbie Margot into the Dreamhouse.
KEN RYAN GOSLING DON’T LOOK AT ME!!!!!
Which makes Allan cry. Barbie Margot goes into the Dreamhouse to comfort him:
Ken Ryan Gosling is lying face down on the bed.
BARBIE MARGOT (to Ken Ryan Gosling)
Hey, are you okay?
KEN RYAN GOSLING (snort)
Yeah... I’m fine. Totally.
BARBIE MARGOT
It’s OK if you’re crying. I cried
too. It’s kind of amazing.
KEN RYAN GOSLING (sobbing)
I know. I’m a liberated man. I know crying isn’t weak.
BARBIE MARGOT
Do you want to sit up for a minute?
103.

 He does.
KEN RYAN GOSLING (still crying)
It was hard running stuff. I didn’t love it.
I get it.
BARBIE MARGOT
KEN RYAN GOSLING (crying harder)
And those mini-fridges are so small! You can only fit like a six- pack in them, and the freezers are basically USELESS. And, to be honest, once I found out patriarchy isn’t about horses, I kind of lost interest anyway...
He heaves and ugly cries, snot dripping from his nose. Barbie Margot tries to comfort him but kind of realizes she should just let this finish on its own.
That’s OK!
BARBIE MARGOT
KEN RYAN GOSLING
I always thought this would be our
house.
BARBIE MARGOT
Oh... Ken. (gently)
I think I owe you an apology. I’m sorry I took you for granted. Not every night had to be girl’s night.
Ken wipes his tears, nods a thank you. We see that Ken is reflected in Barbie’s eye - Ken sees it too. He leans in for a kiss. She backs away.
BARBIE MARGOT
No, I didn’t mean to suggest--
KEN RYAN GOSLING (standing up)
I don’t know who I am without you!
BARBIE MARGOT You’re Ken.
104.

 KEN RYAN GOSLING
But it’s Barbie AND Ken. There is
no just Ken. That’s why I was created - I only exist within the warmth of your gaze. Without you I’m just some blonde guy who can’t do flips.
Ken Ryan Gosling runs to the edge of the house, dramatically.
BARBIE MARGOT
Maybe it’s time for you to discover
who Ken is.
Ken leans in AGAIN for the kiss.
BARBIE MARGOT KEN RYAN GOSLING No-- That’s not what I’m-- OK, I think I got it.
Ken is bursting with feeling, leaning over a few more times to try to kiss her even though he knows that’s not the solution. He just tries to accept it. He looks crazy.
KEN RYAN GOSLING
I feel so stupid. I look SO stupid.
I LOOK SO STUPID!!!!
ALL THE KENS DOWN BELOW NO! YOU LOOK SO COOL!!
BARBIE MARGOT
Ken, you have to figure out who you
are without me. You’re not your girlfriend, you’re not your house, you’re not your mink.
Beach?
KEN RYAN GOSLING
BARBIE MARGOT
No, not even beach. Maybe all the
things you thought made you you aren’t... really you. Maybe it’s Barbie AND... it’s Ken.
KEN RYAN GOSLING Ken... is me?
YES!
Ken is me!
BARBIE MARGOT KEN RYAN GOSLING
105.

 BARBIE MARGOT (quietly, to herself)
And I’m Barbie...
KEN RYAN GOSLING The Kens call out from below.
KEN IS ME!
And ME!
And ME!
KEN KINGSLEY
KEN SIMU
Ken Ryan Gosling clutches his mink in his arms as he looks down to Ken Kingsley. And then he tosses it dramatically into the air.
KEN RYAN GOSLING I want you to have it.
Ken Kingsley dons the faux mink coat. He turns to the crowd:
KEN KINGSLEY (with all the gravitas)
We were only fighting because we didn’t know who we were.
Ken Ryan Gosling goes down the slide
KEN RYAN GOSLING Ken is me!!!!
Suddenly, there is clapping. And weeping. The Mattel CEO exits the treehouse. He is somehow clapping and weeping the hardest.
MATTEL CEO (weeping)
Ken is RIGHT. It is SO HARD to be a leader.
He sees Midge standing next to him, screams.
MATTEL CEO
AHHHH!!!! Midge. God. I thought we
discontinued her. (recovering)
Do you know how many times I’ve just wanted to stand up in a board meeting and say, “Let’s just tickle each other!” Let’s have a company retreat and just tickle each other!
106.

 The Mattel execs all join in and tickle their CEO, who is giggling like a little kid. Aaron Dinkins’ tickle turning into a hug:
MATTEL CEO NO NO NO don’t hug me!
(moving on...)
But thanks to the Barbies I too can relieve myself of this heavy existential burden while holding onto the very real title of CEO and we can restore everything in Barbie Land to exactly the way it was.
107.
 BARBIE ISSA But, Mr. Mattel--
BARBIE ISSA No thank you.
MATTEL CEO Please call me Mother.
(stepping forward)
I don’t think it should go back to just the way it was.
(looking to Weird Barbie)
No Barbie or Ken should be living in the shadows.
ALLAN Or Allan.
Nobody notices he says this. President Barbie approaches Weird Barbie:
BARBIE ISSA
I’m sorry we called you Weird
Barbie behind your back and also to your face.
WEIRD BARBIE
That’s OK, I’m owning it now.
BARBIE ISSA
Would you like a job in my cabinet?
WEIRD BARBIE
May I please have sanitation?
BARBIE ISSA It’s yours.
A gaggle of Kens approach, excited.
KEN KINGSLEY
Madame President, please could the
Kens get one Supreme Court justice?

 BARBIE ISSA Whoa whoa, I can’t do maybe a lower circuit
judgeship--
KEN SIMU
We accept! As long as
robes.
that. But court
we can wear
HELEN MIRREN (V.O) Well the Kens have to start
somewhere. And one day the Kens will have as much power and influence in Barbie Land as women have in the real world.
Sasha pokes at Gloria, prompting her.
GLORIA
(role reversal to her
daughter)
Okay, stop! I’ll do it! STOP!
(to the group, brave voice)
I’ve got an idea.
MATTEL CEO
(to Gloria, making weird
eye contact)
Tell me your secret dream child.
GLORIA (interrupting)
What about, “Ordinary Barbie.” (brainstorming, excited)
She’s not extraordinary! She just has a flattering top and wants to get through the day! Because it’s OK to just want to be a mom or to want to be president or a mom who is president or not a mom who is also not president.
The Mattel CEO looks at Mattel Executive #1 the numbers on an iPad.
MATTEL CEO That’s a terrible idea.
MATTEL EXECUTIVE #1 Yeah that’s going to make money.
MATTEL CEO
Oh! “Ordinary Barbie.” I love it.
who quickly runs
108.

 MATTEL CEO
Ok! We’re good, everyone good?
(to the everyone)
Let’s now do the work to restore the portal between our worlds.
Everyone cheers. Sasha finds Barbie Margot in the crowd. Barbie Margot claps, and looks happy, but something is missing too.
SASHA
Hey wait, what about Barbie?
MATTEL CEO What do you mean?
The Barbies nod.
BARBIES/KENS
Yeah, what about Barbie?!/What’s
her ending? SASHA
What does she get?
MATTEL CEO (that’s easy)
Oh, that’s easy! She’s in love with Ken.
SASHA
That’s not her ending!
BARBIE MARGOT I’m not in love with Ken.
MATTEL CEO (flustered)
Well what do you want?
BARBIE MARGOT (tears up)
I, I don’t know... I’m not really sure where I belong anymore. I don’t think I have an ending.
A VOICE ON THE WIND That was always the point. I
created you so you wouldn’t have an ending.
Coming toward her on the road, backlit by the sun, is a small, well dressed woman holding a hand bag.
109.
 
 BARBIE MARGOT (quietly)
It’s you.
It’s Ruth, the woman from the 50’s kitchen in the Mattel offices. Barbie Margot meets her half-way:
BARBIE MARGOT You’re Ruth, from Mattel.
Then Ruth goes from being some ethereal God-like figure to a comedian, angelic act dropped.
RUTH
Baby I am Mattel, until the IRS got
to me, which is another movie. I Remington Steeled it for a while with my husband, but I’m the brains of the operation.
BARBIE MARGOT So you’re...?
RUTH (little bow)
Ruth Handler, inventor of Barbie.
MATTEL CEO (stage whisper)
Her ghost keeps an office on the 17th floor.
Whispers and looks amongst the Barbies and Kens.
RUTH
What? You think the lady who
invented Barbie looked like Barbie? Ha! I’m a five foot nothing Grandma with a double mastectomy and tax evasion issues. Nobody looks like Barbie. Except, of course, Barbie. Take a bow, honey.
BARBIE MARGOT
I don’t feel like Barbie though,
not anymore.
Ruth gestures to Barbie Margot.
RUTH Walk with me.
110.
 
 Barbie takes Ruth’s hand. They head down the road. The cul-de- sac of Barbies and Kens and Mattel all do a slow theater wave goodbye. Ken Ryan waves, heartfelt:
KEN RYAN GOSLING Thank you, Barbie. Thank you.
INT. ORIGIN SPACE
A vast empty space, almost like reflecting sand on a beach, softly illuminated by different, changing colors.
RUTH
Tell me your troubles.
BARBIE MARGOT Is this therapy?
RUTH
No, you’re talking to a ghost from
the 1950s!
BARBIE MARGOT Well, I don’t know what I’m
supposed to do... I’ve always just been Stereotypical Barbie, I don’t
think I’m good at anything
RUTH
You saved Barbie Land from
patriarchy.
BARBIE MARGOT That was very much a group
RUTH
And you helped that Mother
Daughter connect.
else.
effort. and
BARBIE MARGOT
They really helped each other.
RUTH
Maybe you’re Self-Effacing Barbie?
BARBIE MARGOT
Maybe I’m not Barbie anymore.
Barbie Margot says this before she realized that she’d said it and then immediately realizes it’s true.
RUTH
You understand that humans only
have one ending. (MORE)
111.

 RUTH (CONT’D)
Ideas live forever, humans, not so
much. You know that right?
I do.
BARBIE MARGOT
RUTH
Being a human can be pretty
uncomfortable.
I know.
BARBIE MARGOT
RUTH
I mean humans make things up like
patriarchy and Barbie just to deal with how uncomfortable it is.
BARBIE MARGOT I understand.
RUTH And then you die.
BARBIE MARGOT (nodding)
I want... I want to be part of the people that make meaning, not the thing that’s made. I want to be the one imagining, not the idea itself. Does that make sense?
RUTH (chuckling)
I always knew that Barbie would surprise me, but I never expected this.
BARBIE MARGOT
Do you give me permission? To
become human? RUTH
You don’t need my permission.
BARBIE MARGOT
But you’re The Creator. You
me.
RUTH
Ha! I can’t control you any
than I could control my own daughter! I named you after
Barbara.
(MORE)
control
more her -
112.

 She does.
She does.
RUTH (CONT’D)
And I always hoped for you like I
hoped for her. We mothers stand still so our daughters can look back to see how far they’ve come.
BARBIE MARGOT (figuring it out)
So being human isn’t something I need to ask for or even want, it’s something I discover I am...?
RUTH
I can’t, in good conscience, let
you take that leap without knowing what it means. Take my hands.
RUTH
Now close your eyes.
RUTH Now... FEEL.
We see details of Barbie Margot, her eye, her forearm, her pulse. Life.
And she feels and sees what a human life is. The joy and pain of being mortal. All that she will lose and gain.
We see FLASHES of life lived, unadorned home footage of many women’s lives - happiness, sadness, big moments, little moments, childhood, adulthood, old age, how it all rushes by in one moment, each life drifting into the next somehow capturing the current that runs through all things.
BACK TO BARBIE: Tears roll down Barbie Margot’s face. She opens her eyes and says one thing:
BARBIE MARGOT
YES.
EXT. REAL WORLD. LOS ANGELES. DAY
We BOOM down to the streets of LA.
HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)
So Barbie left behind the pastels
and plastic of Barbie Land for the pastels and plastic of Los Angeles.
113.

 Gloria pulls up to the curb. Nerdy Well Meaning Dad rides shotgun, Sasha and Barbie Margot in the backseat.
BARBIE MARGOT (excited, anxious)
Well, thanks for the lift.
GLORIA SASHA You’ve got this. I’m so proud of you.
NERDY WELL MEANING DAD Estoy muy orgullosa de ti.
BARBIE MARGOT
Thank you, you guys are the best.
Ok, lets do this.
NERDY WELL MEANING DAD Sí se puede!
GLORIA
That’s a political statement.
SASHA
That’s appropriation, Dad!
They all cheer her on as she walks from the car into a big building. We see that she’s wearing Birkenstocks - PINK, of course, but still, Birks.
INT. OFFICE. CONTINUOUS.
Nervous, happy, she finds the right door, and walks up to a reception desk. To the woman behind the glass:
BARBIE MARGOT RECEPTIONIST BARBIE MARGOT
Hi...
Name?
Oh, um, Handler comma Barbara.
RECEPTIONIST
And what are you here for today,
Barbara?
And then she says, with so much pride, so much anticipation, so much meaning, so much deep joy:
BARBIE MARGOT
I’m here to see my gynecologist.
114.

 115. CUT TO BLACK BEFORE ANYONE CAN EVEN PROCESS THAT SENTENCE.
The End.
