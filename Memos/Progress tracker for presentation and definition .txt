For the Dissertation 
* I need to make the Demo 
	*For the Demo I need 3 things :

1. Identify the knowledge store which would be used in a RAG pipeline for Q&A.
2. Devise Methodology to go about the Q&A.
3. Looking at the Gap in performance of some local LLMs, training them on specific Dataset and then comparing their performance with new Metric.
4. Use RAGAS and Promptfoo thoroughly to build demo 
5. Demo to be run in Jupyter Notebook for final result 
6. Have NLP based analytics running on the responses received from the LLM 
7. Identify the Results, store and run analysis on them. 
8. Based on the primary experiments created, record and do the experiments 




Task Force and precedence now, 
1. Choose metrics I want to use -> index them for literature review 
2. store individual metrics associated with the query and the response.
