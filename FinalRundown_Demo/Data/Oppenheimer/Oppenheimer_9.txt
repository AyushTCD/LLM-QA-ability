No.

You never said 'a man at the

would anyone present such an elabourate fiction?
OPPENHEIMER
Because I was an idiot. I found
myself trying to give a tip to the intelligence people, without realizing that when you give a tip you have to offer the whole story. Asked for details, I went off on a false pattern. There was no microfilm, no consular attaché. There weren’t three or more people involved on the project. There was one person involved. That was me.
ROBB Why lie?
OPPENHEIMER
Clearly with the intention of not
revealing who was the intermediary.

GARRISON
And how long have you known Dr
Oppenheimer?
RABI
Since 1928. I know him quite well.
GARRISON
Well enough to speak on the bearing
of his character, loyalty and associations?
RABI
Dr Oppenheimer is a man of
upstanding character, loyal to the United States, to his friends and to the institutions of which he is a part. I’ve examined his security file, and in spite of the associations in there, I do not believe Dr Oppenheimer is a security risk, and that these associations from the past should bar him from continuing as a consultant to the AEC.

Dr Rabi, after the Russian A-bomb

RABI
You’d be better off asking him.
ROBB
I fully intend to. Did he come to
you about the Hydrogen bomb?
RABI
Yes. We all felt that after the
Russian explosion we had to do something to regain our position.
ROBB
So you agreed with those who felt
we should launch a programme for the Super at that time?
RABI
No. There were all kinds of
legitimate concerns about the allocation of our resources.
GRAY
Would you say Dr Oppenheimer was
LATER

RABI
No. He thought a fusion programme
would come at the expense of our awfully good fission programme.

But that proved not to be the case?

If you want to set me up on the

ROBB Why?
RABI
He’s a consultant- you don’t want
to consult the guy? Don’t. Why go through all this against a man

It appears to most scientists

Dr Bush, I thought I was performing
a service to my country in hearing this case.
BUSH
No board in this country should sit
in judgement of a man because he expressed strong opinions. If you want to try that case, you can try me- I have expressed strong opinions, often unpopular, many times. I’m doing so right now.
