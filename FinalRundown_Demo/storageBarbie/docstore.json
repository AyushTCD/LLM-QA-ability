A DESERT-LIKE-LANDSCAPE. DAY\nLike Kubrick\u2019s 2001, but with little girls, not apes. And with baby dolls, not sticks and stuff.\nHELEN MIRREN (V.O.) Since the beginning of time, since\nthe first little girl ever existed, there have been dolls.\nThese little girls rock their baby dolls, they burp them, they cuddle them: They pretend to be Moms.\nHELEN MIRREN (V.O.) But the dolls were always and\nforever baby dolls. The girls who played with them could only ever play at being MOTHERS. Which can be fun, at least for a while anyway... Ask your mother.\n(pause)\nThis continued, until...\nOne of the girls looks UP.\nSomething has appeared in their midst. Something NEW.\nIt\u2019s a GIANT BARBIE DOLL - BARBIE MARGOT, the 1950s Barbie, with her black and white swimsuit and lipstick.\nThe girls react with awe.\nThey\u2019re stirred up and excited by this Barbie Margot not unlike the apes in that Kubrick masterpiece. They try to touch her, and one little girl starts smashing her baby doll against the ground until it breaks into pieces. She lets out a child\u2019s howl!\nOne by one the little girls follow suit: whooping, screaming, throwing their baby dolls away in fits of joyful anger.\nA final little girl throws her baby doll up in the air, and it is spinning, spinning - with a match cut to:\nBARBIE\nINT. WHITE SPACE\nBarbie stands in a empty space of the soon-to-be formed Barbie Land - it\u2019s a void, a limbo - but clearly in a film studio. The World of Barbie is a Technicolor Soundstage.\n  \n HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)\nYes Barbie changed everything! Then\nshe changed it all again!\nWe go through all the changes to Barbie Margot, as she moves through the decades.\nHELEN MIRREN (V.O.)\nAll of these women are Barbie, and\nBarbie is all of these women. She might have started out as just a lady in a bathing suit, but she became so much more.\nWe see a row of Barbies. As we move back we see that \u201cBarbie\u201d is a EVERY different kind of woman -- every profession, every ethnicity, every body shape, every different ability and every gift. As we pan by each one, we hear:\nHELEN MIRREN (V.O.) She has her own money, her own\nhouse, her own car, her own career. Because Barbie can be anything, women can be anything.\nWe see a Map with Barbie Land on it and a long red arrow is drawn across a split screen to the Real World.\nHELEN MIRREN (V.O.) (triumphantly)\nAnd this has been reflected back onto the little girls of today in the Real World.\nGirls playing with the different dolls. The girls all mirror what their Barbie is. So the doctor is the doctor, the ballerina is the ballerina, etc.\nHELEN MIRREN (V.O.) Girls can grow into women who can\nachieve everything and anything they set their mind to.\nFinally, we see a vast sea of Barbies. All in different outfits, different hairstyles, adding new friends, speaking different languages. And now Barbie\u2019s world gets continually multi-faceted and wide-ranging and diverse and interesting.\nHELEN MIRREN (V.O.) (triumphantly)\nThanks to Barbie all problems of feminism and equal rights have been\nsolved!\n(MORE)\n2.\n    \n HELEN MIRREN (V.O.) (CONT'D) (with a knowing smirk)\n... at least that\u2019s what the Barbies think.\nWe float above the Barbies into the clouds, then we descend to earth, to see, just below the clouds and above land, the heart-shaped BARBIE LAND.\nHELEN MIRREN (V.O.) After all they\u2019re living in Barbie\nLand. Who am I to burst their bubble? And here is one of those Barbies now, living her best day every day.\nINT. BARBIE DREAMHOUSE. BEDROOM.
