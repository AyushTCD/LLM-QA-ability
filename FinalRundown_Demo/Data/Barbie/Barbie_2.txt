ke song. But you can stop by, sure.
KEN RYAN GOSLING (with obvious admiration)
Cool.
EXT. / INT. BARBIE MARGOT’S DREAMHOUSE & STREET. NIGHT.
Barbie Margot has a big block party with all her Barbie friends, plus Allan and Midge (whom we stay away from!)
DJ BARBIE turns up a song (which is the AMAZING ORIGINAL HIT SONG FOR THIS MOVIE) and there is a GIANT gorgeous musical number, starring the Barbies! With Kens as dancing decoration! It’s fun and sweeping and funny and a real toe- tapper all around.
Ken Simu joins Barbie Margot for part of the dance, stoking Ken Ryan Gosling’s ire, who is held back, in a dancing way, by Ken Kingsley.

Ken Simu enraged.
Gosling jumps up and tries to breakdance badly. Ken joins in for moral support..
KEN SIMU
Hey Barbie! Check me out!
does a flip on the dance floor. Ken Ryan Gosling is
11.

 Barbie Margot turns and dances with her friends whom she’d much rather be dancing with anyway. This leaves the Kens all dancing together, which is just obviously funny.
Shouting over the music and dancing, Barbie Margot and friends appreciate how terrific everything is:
BARBIE ALEXANDRA (while dancing)
This is a real rager, Barbie!
BARBIE MARGOT (also dancing)
THANKS BARBIE! Gosh this night is just perfect!
BARBIE SHARON It’s perfectly perfect!
BARBIE EMMA
You look so beautiful Barbie!
BARBIE MARGOT Thank you Barbie! I FEEL so
beautiful!
So do I!
This is the best day ever!
Dancing and shouting and so happy it almost hurts:
BARBIE MARGOT
It IS the best day ever! And so is
yesterday and so is tomorrow and so is the day after tomorrow and even Wednesdays and every day from now until FOREVER!
Suddenly, as the flip side of the coin of this thought:
BARBIE MARGOT (still shouting)
Do you ever think about dying?!
Literal record scratch and everything is quiet. All the Barbies and Kens look at her. She’s broken the movie.
BARBIE MARGOT (to herself)
I don’t know why I just said that? (MORE)
BARBIE SHARON
BARBIE HARI
12.

 BARBIE MARGOT (CONT’D) (to everyone else)
I’m just dying to DANCE!
There is panic in Barbie Margot’s eyes as she starts maniacally dancing, doing about eight different dance moves from over the decades, starting with the Twist, going through disco, punk, break dancing, etc.
The music picks back up, and she is relieved, although troubled by what just happened. She shakes it off, and continues to party. Maybe there is nothing wrong!
LATER THAT EVENING...
After their fun party, Barbie Margot and Ken Ryan Gosling stand in the moonlight. Ken leans forward for a goodnight kiss. He gets part of the way there and then pulls back.
KEN RYAN GOSLING (re: the “kiss”)
Wow.
You can go now.
KEN RYAN GOSLING
I was thinking that maybe I could,
you know, stay over tonight?
13.
 Why?
BARBIE MARGOT
BARBIE MARGOT (smiling sweetly)
KEN RYAN GOSLING
‘Cause we’re girlfriend boyfriend.
BARBIE MARGOT To do what?
KEN RYAN GOSLING To... I’m not actually sure...
BARBIE MARGOT But I don’t want you here.
She’s smiling her gorgeous smile. Not mean, just truthful.
KEN RYAN GOSLING (bummed)
Ok.
(pause)
Is it Ken?

 BARBIE MARGOT
No, Ken is just a good friend.
(as if it’s comforting:)
And after all, this is MY Dreamhouse. It’s Barbie’s Dreamhouse. Not Ken’s Dreamhouse. Right?
KEN RYAN GOSLING (chastened)
Right as always.
BARBIE MARGOT And: It’s girl’s night!
We cut to the other side of them to reveal that all of Barbie Margot’s friends are there, watching it all unfold.
BARBIE EMMA (O.S.) Come on, Barbie, slumber party!
BARBIE HARI
Come on! The president is here!
BARBIE ISSA I am. You’re welcome!
KEN RYAN GOSLING Every night is girl’s night.
BARBIE MARGOT Every night! Forever!
KEN RYAN GOSLING (nodding)
Every night.
BARBIE MARGOT Forever and ever! Goodnight!
She runs back to her friends. They scream and are THRILLED. Phew, Ken was a LOT!
KEN RYAN GOSLING (acting out the fantasy)
I love you too. But I can’t... I gotta go.
And then he leaves, thank goodness. She likes Ken, but she needs her space!
INT. BARBIE DREAMHOUSE, BEDROOM. NIGHT. LATER. Barbie Margot tucks herself into bed:
14.
 
 BARBIE MARGOT
(to her Barbie neighbors) Goodnight Barbies! I’m definitely
not thinking about death any more! Her eyes fly open - she IS THOUGH.
INT. BARBIE DREAMHOUSE, BEDROOM. MORNING.
MORNING! Barbie opens her eyes, ready for an amazing day. But something is off, she can feel it - she feels groggy, her eyes don’t want to open. She stretches, stiff from sleeping.
15.
 She makes a INT. BARBIE
She brushes difference.
face, cups her hands and smells her breath. YUCK! DREAMHOUSE, BATHROOM. DAY
her teeth with nothing, but the gesture makes a
Same shower situation, but suddenly Barbie YELPS and leaps out of the way of the non-water.
BARBIE What the--
How was the water that isn’t even there COLD?! She adjusts the knobs and then steps back under the non-water. Better.
KITCHEN
Same breakfast situation, but the plastic waffle is burnt - how is that even possible? She pours milk into a glass (which is nothing) and drinks. Spits it out. Looks at the container.
BARBIE Expired?!
Barbie Margot turns and sees (because remember there are no walls) another Barbie at her breakfast table, who smiles and waves. Barbie Margot tries to muscle through it - she’s going to try to smile her way out of this, darn it!
But what is this new feeling? Is it... shame? EXT. BARBIE DREAMHOUSE. DAY
Barbie Margot stands at the edge of the roof, waiting to be flown into her car, and she leans into the air and...
FALLS. Just belly flops into the air.
She pops up out from behind her car, trying to save face, waving.

 BARBIE MARGOT (to nobody)
I’m fine! A-ok!
People look at her curiously. What is wrong with her?
EXT. BARBIE LAND. BEACH. DAY
Barbie Margot and Co. all hang out together on the beach. It’s pretty fun, but not perfect fun.
The Barbies play a wicked game of Beach Volleyball while the Kens cheer (like reverse Top Gun, remember this).
ALLAN Great cheer, Kens!
Everyone else laughs earnestly but when Barbie Margot tries, it’s forced.
BARBIE MARGOT (tripping over the laugh)
Ha, ha. Ha ha ha ha ha.Ha.
Something is wrong. Why can’t she really laugh?
BARBIE ANA (calling out)
Come on, Barbie, let’s run towards the water!
Barbie Margot steps up on her tip-toes and wobbles weirdly on the sand. She can’t hold it any longer, her foot cramps and she topples to the ground. She looks down and discovers that her feet are - SHOCK! HORROR! - No longer arched!!!
She’s just got big ole flat feet. She gasps and tries to crawl herself to the beach bench. Barbie Alexandra, Barbie Hari, Barbie Sharon, Barbie Emma and Barbie Ana rush over:
16.
   Fell?!
BARBIE SHARON Hey Barbie, are you OK?
BARBIE MARGOT Yeah, Barbie, I just fell...
BARBIE HARI BARBIE MARGOT (looking around)
I’m so... embarrassed.
BARBIE ALEXANDRA Barbie doesn’t get embarrassed!

 BARBIE MARGOT
Barbie, I think my - I don’t even
have any context for this, but - I think my feet are - my heels are on the ground.
WHAT?!
BARBIE ANA
BARBIE MARGOT
I’m no longer on my tip-toes.
BARBIE HARI Let me see.
(gasp!) FLAT FEET!!
Barbie Hari throws up nothing. Same with Barbie Alexandra. Ken Kingsley joins in, throwing up nothing.
BARBIE SHARON Stop it, Ken.
KEN KINGSLEY (nauseous)
I’m sorry... I’m sorry... The Barbies ignore him.
BARBIE MARGOT (panicking)
I know I’m Stereotypical Barbie, and therefore don’t form conjectures concerning the causality of adjacent unfolding events, but some stuff has been happening that might be related: bad breath this morning, a cold shower, burnt waffle, falling off my roof...
Barbie Alexandra gasps, hand over mouth.
BARBIE ALEXANDRA You’re malfunctioning!
BARBIE MARGOT What? No, I’m just, am I?
BARBIE EMMA (horrifyingly drawn in)
I’ve never seen this kind of malfunction.
(MORE)
17.

 BARBIE EMMA (CONT’D) It’s usually just hair related. You
know - you’re going to have to visit... Weird Barbie.
BARBIE MARGOT
But I’ve never had to go visit
Weird Barbie.
BARBIE HARI That’s because you’ve never
malfunctioned.
BARBIE SHARON
I heard that she used to be the
most beautiful Barbie of all but then someone played too hard with her in the Real World...
CUT TO: The REAL WORLD with a little girl doing that thing we all do to our Barbies at some point. She snips off her hair, colors her face with marker, lights her hair on fire, puts her in the splits and drop kicks her into her toy bin.
BACK TO: Barbie Margot looking concerned. Barbie Hari is in a trance of the Legend of Weird Barbie:
BARBIE HARI
...and now she’s fated to an
eternity of making other Barbies perfect while falling more and more into disrepair herself. And that we call her Weird Barbie all the time both behind her back and also to her face.
(happy again)
Anyway, you have to go see her!
BARBIE MARGOT
Ugh, she’s SO Weird. And why is she
always in the splits? EXT/INT. WEIRD BARBIE’S WEIRDHOUSE. DAY
Barbie Margot climbs the seemingly never-ending stairs up to the Weirdhouse. It’s like an abstract art version of every girl’s Dreamhouse after she’s played with it for years. Think Jeff Koons, Gaudi, Murakami all put in a blender.
BARBIE MARGOT
I would never wear heels if my feet
were shaped this way!
Barbie Margot steps gingerly in, looking around.
18.
 
 Um, hello?
BARBIE MARGOT
Barbie Margot frowns. A dog (Tanner) passes by and poops out little plastic pellets. Barbie Margot steps around them.
WEIRD BARBIE (O.S.) (from the dark)
What’s cookin’ good lookin’?
A pool of light illuminates Weird Barbie - she’s in the splits, has an unintentionally asymmetrical short haircut and mismatched clothes. She’s like David Bowie + a hairless cat.
WEIRD BARBIE
Welcome, welcome to my Weirdhouse.
Weird Barbie hitches her leg down and lopes oddly into a giant room. Maybe she does a flip or two.
WEIRD BARBIE (looking at the floor)
Sorry about the dog crap! Why anyone would want to introduce pooping into a doll universe is beyond me.
HELEN MIRREN (V.O.) (with distain)
Or pregnancy.
WEIRD BARBIE (moving on)
What can I do you for?
BARBIE MARGOT (taking off her heels)
I had to come see you about -- My feet -- they’re um...
WEIRD BARBIE (looking)
FLAT! HA!
(with interest)
I’ve never seen that before...
BARBIE MARGOT Yeah. Can you fix them?
WEIRD BARBIE (suspicious)
You’re Stereotypical Barbie, aren’t you?
19.

 BARBIE MARGOT Uh, yeah...
WEIRD BARBIE
That Ken of yours is one nice
looking little protein pot.
BARBIE MARGOT Um, I guess.
WEIRD BARBIE
I’d love to see what kind of nude
blob he’s packing under those jeans.
She claps her open hands together like the way little kids mash Barbies together. Barbie Margot watches with horror. It goes on too long and then stops as suddenly as it started:
WEIRD BARBIE Anyway. What preceded this?
BARBIE MARGOT
Oh, um, nothing. A really fun game
of volleyball...
Oh.
What? WEIRD BARBIE
What?!
BARBIE MARGOT
Really?!
WEIRD BARBIE
BARBIE MARGOT Is that a problem?
WEIRD BARBIE (concerned)
Oh.
BARBIE MARGOT
WEIRD BARBIE
I’d heard this was possible but
I’ve never seen it happen before.
Never?!
BARBIE MARGOT
20.
 BARBIE MARGOT (mumbles)
Thoughts of death.
Weird Barbie looks at her horrified. Small voice:

 WEIRD BARBIE You’ve opened a portal!
BARBIE MARGOT I didn’t open a portal!
WEIRD BARBIE
Well, someone did! There is a rip
in the continuum that is the membrane between Barbie Land and the Real World and if you want to be Stereotypical Barbie perfect again you’ve got to go fix it! Or you’re going to keep going funny. Look at your upper thigh.
She does. Ack! A dimple.
BARBIE MARGOT What is that?!
WEIRD BARBIE
CELLULITE. It’ll spread EVERYWHERE
and you’ll start getting mushy and sad and... complicated.
BARBIE MARGOT
NO!!! What do I have to do?!?
With that, Weird Barbie turns and travels through her house, up and over all of the strange architecture. Barbie Margot tries to keep up.
WEIRD BARBIE
You have to go to the Real World
and find the girl who is playing with you.
BARBIE MARGOT Playing with me?
Weird Barbie goes through the mess around her, finding a technical drawing which she refers to briefly and then gets tired and throws it back on the stack.
WEIRD BARBIE
We’re all being played with! Usually there’s some kind of
separation: there’s the Girl, aka the Player, and the Doll, aka the Playee. And never the twain shall cross.
21.

 BARBIE MARGOT The twain is crossing?
WEIRD BARBIE (another drawing)
Yes! The girl playing with you must be sad and her thoughts and feelings and humanness are interfering with your dollness. Am I being too technical?
BARBIE MARGOT
Why would she be sad? We fixed
everything so that all women in the real world are happy and powerful!
WEIRD BARBIE I DON’T KNOW!
(looking at her hard)
If you ask me, you’re responsible for this, too. It usually takes two to rip the portal.
BARBIE MARGOT
ME?! But I
