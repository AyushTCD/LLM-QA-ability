He was never employed at Los

Our security was the tightest we
could make it given the personalities involved. But attempts were made. Doctor, we’ve all read your file here. Do we need to talk about Jean Tatlock? Or the Chevalier incident?

Why would anyone on the project
want that?

Frankly, I can see there might be
